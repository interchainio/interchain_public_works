This issue tracks outstanding obstacles, to coordinate changes between interchaintest, upstream penumbra, and potentially the [relayer](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer).\r\n\r\n- [x] The CLI flag for `pd`, specifying the target Tendermint RPC address, `--tendermint-addr`, should have an `http://` prefix. `pd` was rather silently failing when this option was not set correctly. Patched upstream via https://github.com/penumbra-zone/penumbra/pull/2719\r\n- [x] Write example golang code that takes a Penumbra address as bytes and converts it to a string representation. [See example here](https://github.com/penumbra-zone/penumbra-bech32m-debug/blob/6b282958338651a9b7dc6f2c0825e5b0e2f3505b/main.go#L73-L97).\r\n- [x] Write example golang code that takes a Penumbra address as a string and converts it to a byte slice, suitable for passing to proto RPC methods such as [`BalanceByAddressRequest`](https://buf.build/penumbra-zone/penumbra/docs/main:penumbra.view.v1alpha1#penumbra.view.v1alpha1.BalanceByAddressRequest). Helpful constraints (which should probably be added to Penumbra's proto docs):\r\n  * The byte slice should have length of 80\r\n  * Each element of the slice should be an integer 0-255\r\n  * N.B. we now have more ergonomic protos that accept a bech32m string for an [Address](https://buf.build/penumbra-zone/penumbra/docs/main:penumbra.core.crypto.v1alpha1#penumbra.core.crypto.v1alpha1.Address), but we still need to solve this problem.\r\n- [x] Given that [`BalanceByAddressRequest`](https://buf.build/penumbra-zone/penumbra/docs/main:penumbra.view.v1alpha1#penumbra.view.v1alpha1.BalanceByAddressRequest) returns a stream, we must handle it as a special case from the other RPC calls. Therefore:\r\n  - [x] Write example golang impl for handling a streaming request from pclientd. [See exmaple here](https://github.com/penumbra-zone/penumbra-bech32m-debug/blob/6b282958338651a9b7dc6f2c0825e5b0e2f3505b/main.go#L103-L125).\r\n  - [x] Update the interchaintest calls to handle a streaming request reasonably well (see above for a good enough pattern)\r\n  - [x] Update the Penumbra proto docs to make return types more explicit, to reduce the likelihood of unpleasant surprises. Tracked in https://github.com/penumbra-zone/penumbra/issues/2734\r\n- [x] Testnet liquid allocations for Penumbra within interchaintest are getting clobbered. We haven't figured out why yet, but we're confident that the `upenumbra` allocations are not making it into the genesis file served by Tendermint within interchaintest.\r\n- [x] Update `pcli keys import phrase` to pass the seed phrase on stdin, rather than as a CLI arg.

In `SetupTest` we establish a client/connection/channel etc for the test to act on.\r\n3. Each test has a relayer to act on only the created channel for that test to avoid relayers relaying packets for other tests.\r\n\r\nWe are having an issue with part 3.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of how we construct interchain instances, we need to provide the relayers/links before chain creation. I.e. know details of test execution before the test is running. We would like to be able to lazily create a new relayer instance and wire it up (fund wallet accounts, add chains to config files etc ) in the `SetupTest` phase of each test. \r\n\r\nLooking at some of the code, it looks like the `AddChainConfiguration` and `RestoreKey` functions may be what we need, and are already public, but it seems that there are some [unexported types](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/interchaintest/blob/fa08aa0d58fbe62498a0acabb25d9e55b534a756/interchain.go#L434) being leveraged here.\r\n\r\nI think we would also need access to [this](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/interchaintest/blob/fa08aa0d58fbe62498a0acabb25d9e55b534a756/interchain.go#L374-L381) functionality, however this is at genesis and of course could not be executed after the fact, we would need to be able to create and fund relayer accounts separately. Something similar to `GetAndFundTestUsers` but for relayers basically.\r\n\r\n\r\nA temporary fix that I am experimenting is just pre-loading a bunch of relayers and then fetching one of these for a test. It's not great since it adds a bunch of time to start up, and you will likely create more than you need. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is already a possibility, or there is some workaround to lazily create relayers and wire them up to an `interchain` that is already built!","number":1153,"repository":"strangelove-ventures/interchaintest","title":"Support addition of relayers to existing chain pair outside of interchain.Build","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/interchaintest/issues/1153"},"id":"PVTI_lADOBTYxNs4AkKTLzgQlDiI","repository":"https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/interchaintest","title":"Support addition of relayers to existing chain pair outside of interchain.Build"},{"assignees":["Reecepbcups"],"content":{"body":"When attempting to modify the hermes configuration file using [this](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/interchaintest/blob/02878ba0929563f146ecb6fe9bccf91b6567a986/relayer/docker.go#L152-L154) function, I wanted to apply the following changes\r\n\r\n```golang\r\n    var channelIDs [][]string\r\n    for _, c := range channels {\r\n       channelIDs = append(channelIDs, []string{c.PortID, c.ChannelID})\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    channelIDs = append(channelIDs, []string{\"ica*\", \"*\"})\r\n\r\n    overrides := map[string]any{\r\n       \"chains\": []map[string]interface{}{\r\n          {\r\n             \"id\": chainID,\r\n             \"packet_filter\": map[string]interface{}{\r\n                \"policy\": \"allow\",\r\n                // we explicitly override the full list, this allows this function to provide a complete set of channels to watch.\r\n                \"list\": channelIDs,\r\n             },\r\n          },\r\n       },\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return h.ModifyTomlConfigFile(ctx, \".hermes/config.toml\", overrides)\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e. explicitly adding the packet_filter field for `chainID`.
