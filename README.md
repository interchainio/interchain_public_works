ðŸŒŒ Why did we create interchain_public_works?
=============================

`interchain_public_works` ("IPW") is a public repo which helps coordinate and aggregate backlogs across various interchain projects. 

We believe that 
- people building Interchain software have a problem understanding the state of dependencies across other repos, and
- most of the backlogs use different words and practices for what're effectively the same things

IPW can help by offering Sane Defaults (or "Convention Over Configuration") for the way we manage projects

We'll know we're right, if
- **time blocked by cross-project dependencies goes down** (because everyone'll have better visibility into foreign priorities and velocity), 
- ** the amount of foreign Pull Requests go up** (bc it'll be easier to just write some patches yrself, rather than waiting for the native team to do it).

ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ Who benefits from IPW?
=============================

Anyone who's trying to understand software at a high level across the interchain:

- builders who're doing the work in the backlog who want to understand cross-repo dependencies and have a Sane Default for process (story types, status columns) so that backlogs may be more interoperable
- Interchain-curious and Appchain-thesis-curious people (e.g. developers and investors from other ecosystems) who want a high-level view on the ecosystem
- Grant-issuing and Public Goods actors who're looking to support public works
  

ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ What exactly does IPW do?
=============================

IPW is primarily a GH Issues board, although who knows? Maybe some code will work its way in here.

ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ How do I use it?
=============================

The main board lives at https://github.com/orgs/interchainio/projects/${NUMBER_FOR_PROJECT_CALLED_"interchain_public_works"}.
