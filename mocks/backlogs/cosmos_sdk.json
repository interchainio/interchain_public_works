In these times its hard to pinpoint the exact API's users may want. It has now been almost 3 years since appmodule interfaces were introduced and we have learned a lot on how to simplify things. \r\n\r\nThere is ongoing work with the core api and runtime modules in order to handle lots of the wiring. There will be a migration story, but there are users that may want to take longer to migrate instead of all at once. For these users it makes sense  to spend a few days cleaning up the old apis to make it more ergonomic. Many of the changes would be minimal and could be done in a backwards way\r\n\r\nOn top of the APIs of creating modules, there are other areas where users could benefit from some cleanup. \r\n\r\nSome ideas are:\r\n\r\n- Client api cleanup and ergonomic fixes\r\n - this has come up but would need better insight into how this should progress cc @jackzampolin \r\n- Codegen all cli and grpc for modules to avoid needing to write extra boiler plate \r\n- Separate internal external logic with a internal package in modules\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear from @ValarDragon @ethanfrey @jackzampolin on other things they would like to see.

Overall there are 184 references to `simapp` in other packages (run `Code > Analyze Code > Backwards Dependencies‚Ä¶` on `simapp` in Goland or IntelliJ to create this report). The reason for such widespread usage of simapp in tests is because there needs to be a way to do integration tests in the SDK and simapp provides the key test fixture. Unfortunately, this creates a Gordian knot where all the modules depend on each other and breaking them up is almost impossible. App wiring provides a solution to this problem by creating a way to quickly spin up integration test fixtures locally in each module rather than using a single SDK wide test fixture that brings all these problems.\r\n\r\n## Phase 1: App Wiring MVP\r\n\r\nIn this first phase, we create an MVP of app wiring that has these requirements:\r\n* can refactor a single module (we‚Äôre choosing `x/nft`) to not depend on simapp at all for testing or any other reason\r\n* can refactor part of `simapp/app.go` to use the new app wiring while still wiring up everything else as before - this is required to make the app wiring migration gradual and opt-in\r\n\r\nFor now, the app wiring framework that we will create will forego dealing with any of the messy issues related to [protobuf generated code and semantic versioning](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/11802). This means basically that app wiring will use the global protobuf registry for decoding the app config and the existing gogo proto-based `codec` package will be used elsewhere.\r\n\r\n- [x] Single module (x/nft) tests using app.yaml instead of simapp (full feature branch in #11900), being broken down into separate PRs:\r\n  - [x] #11912 \r\n  - [x] #11913 \r\n  - [x] #11914\r\n  - [x] #11915\r\n  - [x] #11924 \r\n  - [x] additional app wiring setups from #11900 \r\n    - [x] #12019 \r\n    - [x] #12032 \r\n    - [x] #12036\r\n    - [x] #12035\r\n    - [x] #12038\r\n  - [x] x/nft cli tests and testutil/network from #11900\r\n- [x] #11904\r\n- [x] #11905\r\n- [x] #11906\r\n- [x] #11917\r\n- [x] #11925\r\n- [x] #11935\r\n- [x] #11937\r\n\r\n## Phase 2: Decouple modules and packages from simapp\r\nFollowing the patterns demonstrated in `x/nft` do the same for each module and package which depends on `simapp` in the SDK, essentially:\r\n* create a protobuf `Module` config message and register a module implementation with `appmodule.Register`\r\n* inject the new module into simapp\r\n* ~migrate CLI tests to use `appconfig`~ Superseded by #12398\r\n* ~migrate simulations and any other code requiring simapp~ Superseded by #12398\r\n\r\nModules should be migrated starting with those with fewer dependencies on other modules first.\r\n\r\n- [x] #12023\r\n- [x] #12024\r\n- [x] #12084 \r\n- [x] #12073 \r\n- [x] #12194\r\n- [x] #12069 \r\n- [x] #12298\r\n- [x] #12238\r\n- [x] #12302\r\n- [x] #12083\r\n- [x] #12036\r\n- [x] #12195\r\n- [x] #12292 \r\n- [x] #12234\r\n- [x] x/genutil\r\n- [x] #12274\r\n- [x] #12300\r\n\r\nThese other issues can also be addressed incrementally during phase 2:\r\n- [x] #12054\r\n- [x] #12055\r\n- [x] #12056\r\n- [x] #12068 \r\n- [ ] depinject module upgrades based to make this work easier (*nice to have*):\r\n\t- [x] #11907\r\n\t- [x] #11908\r\n\t- [x] #11909\r\n\t- [x] #11910\r\n\t- [x] #11911\r\n\t- [x] #11943\r\n\t- [x] #11944\r\n\t- [x] #12252\r\n- [x] #11903\r\n- [x] #12237\r\n- [x] #12400\r\n\r\nAs this work proceeds, simapp itself can be refactored to use its `app.yaml` more and more - this can be done incrementally as each module is migrated or at the end when simapp is standalone.\r\n\r\nOther packages besides the `x/*` modules depend on `simapp` as well, usually to call `simapp.MakeTestEncodingConfig()` or `simapp.DefaultConsensusParams()`. `DefaultConsensusParams` should have been moved in Phase 1, but `MakeTestEncodingConfig` may require app wiring because it used to build a codec with some modules registered. A strategy for decoupling the following packages from `simapp` will need to be created:\r\n- [x] #12535\r\n- [x] #12544\r\n- [x] #12528\r\n- [x] #12612\r\n- [x] #12619\r\n- [x] #12546\r\n- [x] #12584\r\n\r\nAt this point, a review of all the migrated modules should be performed. The review should verify the tests coverage and the test behaviors is kept unchanged compared to before the migration.\r\n\r\n## Phase 3: Make simapp a standalone go module\r\nInstructions in https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#is-it-possible-to-add-a-module-to-a-multi-module-repository must be followed. Also, we want to make tags off of a release branch, not `main`. It is expected that these steps will be required:\r\n\r\n- [x] make simapp a standalone go module `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/simapp` which imports `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk` probably using a `replace` tag to start. Any remaining dependencies of the rest of the SDK on simapp *must* be removed by now\r\n\r\n## Phase 4: Make all modules standalone\r\n\r\nAgain following the instructions from https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#is-it-possible-to-add-a-module-to-a-multi-module-repository and starting with the modules with the fewest dependencies to the most.\r\nList of To-dos when creating a `go.mod`: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#gomod\r\n\r\n- [x] x/nft\r\n- [x] x/params\r\n- [x] #17936\r\n- [x] x/authz\r\n- [x] [x/feegrant](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/14559)\r\n- [x] [x/crisis](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/14558)\r\n- [x] [x/capability](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/14556)\r\n- [x] [x/upgrade](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/14560)\r\n- [x] [x/evidence](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/14557)\r\n- [x] x/auth\r\n- [x] x/bank\r\n- [x] x/staking\r\n- [x] x/slashing\r\n- [x] x/distribution\r\n- [x] #17813\r\n- [x] #18411\r\n\r\n## Phase 5\r\n\r\n- [ ] audit dependency graph \r\n- [x] #18290\r\n- [x] cleanup intermodule dependency \r\n\r\nNOTE: it may not be possible to move *all* modules out of the core go module with this strategy alone because of other cyclic dependencies between each other (such as `x/auth` and `x/bank`).

One possible approach is to support a set of operators similar to what is supported in [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/).\r\n\r\nEx:\r\n```proto\r\nservice Query {\r\n  rpc Find(FindRequest) returns (FindResponse);\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage FindRequest {\r\n  string table = 1;\r\n  repeated QueryOperator operators = 2;\r\n  repeated Ordering order = 3;\r\n  cosmos.base.query.v1beta1.PageRequest page = 4;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage FindResponse {\r\n  repeated google.protobuf.Any results = 1;\r\n  cosmos.base.query.v1beta1.PageResponse page = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### B) Generic JSON REST service\r\n\r\nSame as the above but with JSON instead of protobuf to allow for a simpler more flexible query language along the lines of what is provided in mongo.\r\n\r\n### C) Generate gRPC .proto files for all tables\r\n\r\nWe could generate a query service for every ORM .proto file and dynamically serve it. For instance, for the bank example in the ORM tests, we would generate a query service somewhat like this:\r\n\r\n```proto\r\nservice Query {\r\n  rpc Balance(QueryBalanceRequest) returns (QueryBalanceResponse);\r\n  rpc Balances(QueryBalancesRequest) returns (QueryBalancesResponse);\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would require another layer of codegen and is more similar to what we currently have with gRPC.\r\n\r\n### D) Graphql\r\n\r\nWhile graphql is a departure from gRPC, it is likely better for building client apps and would allow for getting a bunch of objects in a single query and also traversing some joins (which could be done with additional protobuf annotations). A proposed design to follow is https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/introduction/ which automatically generates Graphql services just from SQL table definitions.\r\n\r\n## Design Considerations\r\n\r\nSome issues to address when designing this are:\r\n\r\n### Storage Types vs Presentation Types\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/issues/930. In particular, in lots of state tables we store addresses as bytes but users are used to seeing these usually as bech32 strings. All of these fields should be annotated with `cosmos.AddressBytes` so a smart query layer could do the conversion.\r\n\r\n### Logical Queries vs Direct Index Access\r\n\r\nORM queries in the state machine are currently done with direct index access and don't really have a separation between a logical and physical plan as more robust databases do. This is probably good for state machines generally because it is more predictable in terms of performance and gas consumption. gRPC queries are also generally written as direct index access just because that's easier to do.\r\n\r\nAn auto-generated client query layer could expose indexes directly as we currently do or include a more generic set of logical query filters like MongoDB or SQL. The latter would require some query planner even if it is fairly naive. The advantage of full logical queries are:\r\n* allows for the same queries regardless of which indexes exist\r\n* is stable between different versions of a state machine which may add/remove indexes\r\n* allows for the same queries to be retargeted against a traditional DB so that clients can write the same app where the backing data store is direct state or something like Postgres or Mongo with indexed data\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I'm leaning towards supporting logical queries with the most naive query planner that is non-trivial (meaning that indexes are selected based on some very simple rule-based heuristics and in memory filtering and sorting are the fallback for all non-trivial cases).","number":11774,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"ORM query service","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/11774"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgBGIDQ","labels":["C:orm"],"priority ":"Low","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"‚òÉÔ∏è Icebox","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"ORM query service"},{"assignees":["alpe","samricotta"],"content":{"body":"Based on the discussions in https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/7773, the decision regarding decimals in the SDK is to use a GDA-based decimal implementation to replace the current `sdk.Dec`. \r\n\r\nThis would likely be based on one of these two libraries and we should plan on providing upstream changes when needed:\r\n* https://github.com/cockroachdb/apd\r\n* https://github.com/ericlagergren/decimal\r\n\r\nThis new decimal type should likely go into a new standalone `math` go module along with a copy of the current `sdk.Int` implementation so these are broken out of the monolithic SDK.\r\n\r\nThe apd-based `Dec` wrapper type in regen-ledger can possibly be the basis for this new `math.Dec` type: https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/tree/master/types/math","number":11783,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"upstream GDA based decimal type","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/11783"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgBGIDg","labels":["T:Epic","C:math"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20085","https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/20536"],"priority ":"High","quarter":"Q3","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","split":"false","sprint":"true","status":"ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è In Progress","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"upstream GDA based decimal type"},{"content":{"body":"It exists for x/gov and should probably be added to x/group along with (#9922)","number":9923,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Add MsgVoteWeighted to x/group","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/9923"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgBGIJo","labels":["S:proposed","C:x/group"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/11158"],"priority ":"Low","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"‚òÉÔ∏è Icebox","title":"Add MsgVoteWeighted to x/group"},{"content":{"body":"## Summary\r\n\r\nAs we know, x/auth is overloaded.

However, the integration of Authz in Defi-like products today prevents protocol engineers from capturing fees and creating an elegant user experience for customers. Authz doesn't allow us to charge a performance fee for our service as authz dynamically can't read state nor does it store a type to charge the fee owned by a user that the delegator can claim. The solution we propose is to implement stateful checks inside an authz execution and incorporate a fee type that can store the fee amount that needs to be paid out after a specific duration. \r\n\r\n## Problem Definition\r\n\r\n<!-- Why do we need this feature? \r\n**What problems may be addressed by introducing this feature?**\r\nWith Authz there is no way to non-custodially capture a performance fee. Capturing a performance fee is needed for yield-based products. Here is an example, auto compounding staking rewards. The issue with authz is there is no way to claim a fee. For instance, Alice goes and noncustodial grants a protocol to auto compound the staking rewards on behalf of Alice for 6 months. Once those 6 months end, the protocol doesn‚Äôt have a way to capture a percentage of rewards it helped Alice accrue. Alice would need to interact with the protocol and send an additional tx to pay the service fee off. This is poor ux creates the risk the protocol won‚Äôt be paid. \r\n\r\n**What benefits does the SDK stand to gain by including this feature?**\r\nAuthz ability to capture a fee would open a new design space in protocol engineering in Web3. Today, the majority of yield generating applications require giving up custody of one's assets to generate that yield. It goes against the very ethos of noncustody. However, the inability to effectively capture a fee for the noncustodial work prevents protocols to provide a safer, noncustodial solution to their community. The addition of capturing a fee based on duration can allow applications to provide noncustodial services. \r\n\r\nAre there any disadvantages of including this feature? -->\r\nThe inclusion of a FeeAuthorization type may be complex and introduce security concerns unaware during implementation. However, this is a risk majority of new implications have and requires thorough testing and safeguards. \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nThe idea is to capture a fee or tax for the authx grant. \r\n\r\n```\r\ntype TaxedAuthorization struct {\r\n    Authorization\r\n    TaxAmount sdk.Coins\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then, inside the Accept method, simply transfer the TaxAmount from the Authorization.Granter to the Authorization.Grantee. The solution would be to implement the statefull checks inside the authz execution, have that released into a new Cosmos SDK version. \r\n\r\nWe worked on this solution with @RiccardoM . Love to hear other input on how to best implement a fee capture mechanism in Authz. The introduction of this improvement will increase the adoption of this module. \r\n____\r\n\r\n#### For Admin Use\r\n\r\n- [ ] Not duplicate issue\r\n- [ ] Appropriate labels applied\r\n- [ ] Appropriate contributors tagged\r\n- [ ] Contributor assigned/self-assigned\r\n","number":11583,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Authz Fee Capture Request ","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/11583"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgBkoDE","labels":["S:proposed","C:x/authz"],"priority ":"Low","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"‚òÉÔ∏è Icebox","title":"Authz Fee Capture Request "},{"content":{"body":"<!-- < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < ‚ò∫ \r\nv                            ‚ú∞  Thanks for opening an issue! ‚ú∞    \r\nv    Before smashing the submit button please review the template.\r\nv    Word of caution: poorly thought-out proposals may be rejected \r\nv                     without deliberation \r\n‚ò∫ > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > >  -->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nSomething thats always confused me is why does `ImportGenesis` and `ExportGenesis` in every module take in a JSON interface.\r\n\r\nWe can definitely change `ExportGenesis` to return a `proto.Message` interface, that the SDK then serializes into a JSON?

The core sdk team needs more insights into what is going on in the real world in order to be able to know they are headed in the right direction for various things in the repo. \r\n\r\n## Work Breakdown\r\n\r\n### Phase 1\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a grafana dashboard with the current metrics that we can host and use to watch various things of the cosmos-sdk. \r\n- [ ] Discuss which metrics we would like to better track as a team. \r\n\r\n\r\n@thanethomson would you like to collaborate on a dashboard we can share for Tendermint and Cosmos-SDK?\r\n\r\n@crodriguezvega would you like to collaborate on this as well for metrics from the ibc modules? \r\n\r\n\r\n> Note: the work breakdown is not complete and this issue may be a longer lived epic in order for us to cover everything we will want. \r\n","number":13566,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Epic: Metrics ","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/13566"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgC-C7s","labels":["C: telemetry","T:Epic"],"priority ":"Medium","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"Epic: Metrics "},{"content":{"body":"<!-- < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < ‚ò∫ \r\nv                            ‚ú∞  Thanks for opening an issue! ‚ú∞    \r\nv    Before smashing the submit button please review the template.\r\nv    Word of caution: poorly thought-out proposals may be rejected \r\nv                     without deliberation \r\n‚ò∫ > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > >  -->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis Epic is slated for tendermint 0.38. \r\n\r\nOne new feature of tendermint 0.38 is being able to add things into the consensus vote. This is an amazing feature for upgrading software. In the future chains will be able to migrate versions of modules once 2/3+ have upgraded to the new binary. Currently when the network hits 2/3+ it is unknown in the state machine this has happened. \r\n\r\n## Problem Definition\r\n\r\nState machine is unaware of network version state. If the state machine is aware when network participants (validators) have upgraded to a new version of the software then upgrades become seamless and allow the outside world to know when a chain is upgraded. \r\n\r\n## Work Breakdown\r\n\r\nThis part is unknown at this time.

This should play more nicely with autocli\r\n- there is a separate list method per index which matches how query servers are structured now (ex. `Groups`, and `GroupsByMember` are separate query methods)\r\n- range queries are removed (for now) - I haven't found any instances of range queries in our gRPC query servers or CLI commands, so I consider this advanced usage.

It mixes a lot of roles into the same data structure, is rather complex, and under-specified. This has led to large numbers of performance and liveness critical bugs, that would be vastly simplified with a redesign.\r\n\r\nI claim that the way to best simplify this is to do an API compatible rewrite, that simplifies the roles of the differing components, and then drop-in replace this.\r\n\r\nThe cache KV store has two roles, each of which has roadmaps for improvement, and potential for tighter integration with gas counting. These are:\r\n- ReadBuffers\r\n- WriteBuffers\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to make a directory structure as follows:\r\n```\r\nstore/cachekv2\r\nstore/cachekv2/readbuffer\r\nstore/cachekv2/writebuffer\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, separate packages, for ReadBuffer and WriteBuffers that allow us to flexibly iterate going forward, and making a for now \"merged CacheKV store API\" that has the exact API guarantees (aside from bug/perf improvements) as the existing one, so theres no break to users. As time goes on, this merged CacheKV store API gets less used. \r\n\r\nThe short-term roadmap proposed:\r\n\r\n- Make a store/cachekv2 with identical external API guarantees as the existing CacheKV\r\n  - The semantic will always be, for reads and iterates, \"attempt iterating over write buffer. If not in write buffer, go to read buffer\"\r\n- Create a ReadBuffer and WriteBuffer interface\r\n- Make the first objects behind the interface, the equivalent object in CacheKV 1\r\n  - ReadBuffer only has data thats in parent, it has no \"dirty\" data.\r\n- Swap cachekv usage with cachekv2\r\n\r\n\r\nThen internal API roadmaps, that can far more simply progress after a basic split:\r\n\r\n- Amend the ReadBuffer to have an interval tree, so it can know during repeated iterations, whether the iteration is already cached. (Today we always hit IAVL on repeat iterations)\r\n  - Ensure single threaded concurrency safety\r\n- Make a new API for Gets, that is also aware of whether the data was in cache or not. Cache gets should be much cheaper than uncached ones.\r\n  - This will be short-term unused, but will get used when we are willing to do a larger API break with the gas store \r\n- Make write buffer single threaded concurrency safe. (As far as I'm aware, a fix for this was merged into SDK, so maybe we just re-use that)\r\n- Consider lifting concurrency safety to multi-threaded safety\r\n- Make Cachewrap only layer a write buffer on top\r\n- Add RAM bounds to ReadBuffer\r\n- Create safer iter_mut API's\r\n\r\nWhats nice about having these split out, is we can also make these re-usable components, as we explore more distinct concurrency designs. Furthermore, we should be expecting different read buffer and write buffer designs to emerge. A lot of performance suffering is had to support iteration, when really there could be flexibility in only making things that need iteration pay that cost.\r\n\r\nIf folks like this direction, I can get started on it.","number":14990,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Proposal for a CacheKV v2 store","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/14990"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgE0FwU","labels":["C:Store"],"priority ":"Low","project":"Store","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"Proposal for a CacheKV v2 store"},{"content":{"body":"<!--\r\nThe default pull request template is for types feat, fix, or refactor.\r\nFor other templates, add one of the following parameters to the url:\r\n- template=docs.md\r\n- template=other.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCloses: #13961 \r\nref: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/13961#issuecomment-1325635509\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Author Checklist\r\n\r\n*All items are required.

there is a need for this to be easier for advanced users. Secondly as we explore different worlds and different consensus engines limiting to what is defined ABCI further limits what can be built. \n\nFor example if a user wanted to use a custom header for specific use cases that may not be as generalizable as the current structure (abci).\n\nThere are many cases where users may want to swap things out for different designs or only use the sdk as a middleware. The current design is limiting in these functions. \n\nThis epic aims to define a couple interfaces that users can swap functionality: consensus, mempool, server, client, commitment, storage and so on.\n\n## Problem Definition\n\nBaseapp is limiting in nature due to the tight coupling of ABCI and degree of understanding in order to have confidence in the changes. \n\n## Work Breakdown\n\n### Phase 1\n\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [x] Begin defining needs of various users\n- [ ] https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/17425\n- [ ] Write ADR on different interfaces\n```\n\n### Phase 2\n\n(After Phase 1 is completed we will have a better idea of the work break down needed for phase 2, for now it will be left as TBD)\n\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] TBD\n```\n\n\n","number":17045,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Epic]: Runtime","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/17045"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgIAN7M","labels":["T:Epic"],"priority ":"Medium","project":"Server","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"üëë Epic","title":"[Epic]: Runtime"},{"content":{"body":"This is an automatic backport of pull request #17089 done by [Mergify](https://mergify.com).\nCherry-pick of 0fa85b7a424d78bfa1703ceb2e245c0bb4bcda22 has failed:\n```\nOn branch mergify/bp/release/v0.47.x/pr-17089\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/release/v0.47.x'.\n\nYou are currently cherry-picking commit 0fa85b7a4.\n  (fix conflicts and run \"git cherry-pick --continue\")\n  (use \"git cherry-pick --skip\" to skip this patch)\n  (use \"git cherry-pick --abort\" to cancel the cherry-pick operation)\n\nUnmerged paths:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to mark resolution)\n\tboth modified:   testutil/configurator/configurator.go\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n```\n\n\nTo fix up this pull request, you can check it out locally.

For context, Polaris supports stateful precompile evm contracts, which allows for smart contracts in our EVM to call Cosmos-SDK modules directly, in this example we are using x/staking (and by proxy x/distribution). \r\n\r\nThis difference in rounding lead to situations where our Ethereum JSON-RPC's Estimate Gas was reporting a lower required gas then what is actually required to execute the transaction leading to failed transactions. Most notably this occurs when a user tries to call `delegate()`. Part of delegating to a validator in the SDK requires withdrawing outstanding rewards in order to allow the passive distribution math ot functional. Notably, on an alternating fashion, we saw that when using the QueryContext the pending rewards for a user was 0, leading to the following control flow to be skipped (https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/ba9d4df6d0d1e8b28631459090b50f8da6aa71b0/x/distribution/keeper/delegation.go#L170) The rewards being 0 (when they shouldnt be) causes the control flow to skip calling into the bank module and thus consumes less gas. This estimated gas is then utilized when the transaciton is submitted on chain, in which the outstanding is no 0, the control flow enters the bank module, consuming the extra gas and resulting in an evm out of gas error.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the issue in our repo: https://github.com/berachain/polaris/issues/480\r\n\r\n@tac0turtle and I have chatted a bit and he thinks that it may be a caching issue with the QueryContext and/or the Root Multistore, but would love others thoughts on this for sure. \r\n\r\n## Version\r\nFrom our `go.mod`\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule pkg.berachain.dev/polaris/cosmos\r\n\r\ngo 1.20\r\n\r\nreplace (\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/x/evidence => cosmossdk.io/x/evidence v0.0.0-20230305125317-672b052f323b\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/x/feegrant => cosmossdk.io/x/feegrant v0.0.0-20230305125317-672b052f323b\r\n\tgithub.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk => github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk v0.46.0-beta2.0.20230305125317-672b052f323b\r\n\tgithub.com/docker/docker => github.com/docker/docker v20.10.3-0.20221013203545-33ab36d6b304+incompatible // 22.06 branch\r\n\t// Required for stateful precompiles and supporting the Ethereum JSON-RPC API.\r\n\tgithub.com/ethereum/go-ethereum => github.com/berachain/polaris-geth v0.0.0-20230320232033-db2035009c47\r\n\tgithub.com/syndtr/goleveldb => github.com/syndtr/goleveldb v1.0.1-0.20210819022825-2ae1ddf74ef7\r\n)\r\n\r\nrequire (\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/api v0.3.1\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/client/v2 v2.0.0-20230220152935-67f04e629623\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/core v0.6.0\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/depinject v1.0.0-alpha.3\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/errors v1.0.0-beta.7\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/log v0.0.0-20230305202224-89c956f8ed3a\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/math v1.0.0-beta.6.0.20230305125317-672b052f323b\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/simapp v0.0.0-20230305125317-672b052f323b\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/store v0.0.0-20230305125317-672b052f323b\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/tools/confix v0.0.0-20230227140543-7c9245dbdf19\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/x/evidence v0.1.0\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/x/feegrant v0.0.0-20230305125317-672b052f323b\r\n\tcosmossdk.io/x/upgrade v0.0.0-20230305125317-672b052f323b\r\n\t//........\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

This can be fixed on stake.tax by using `2` instead of `ORDER_BY_DESC`.

This feature would allow modules to submit events of a certain type (error-events) that will be copied to the parent context when discarding a CacheContext. \r\n\r\n## Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen a message fails only the ante handler events and the error message is returned to the user. We should be able to add context by emitting error-events. This is particularly useful for cosmwasm. \r\n\r\nWasmd allows contracts to initialte submessages and receive the reply. Since events are not part of concensus there are no determinism guarantees on them, which is why wasmd removes the events before sending the respons back to the caller contract. Error details and logs are also removed because of non-determinism concerns.\r\n\r\nThis makes it very difficult for contract to provide proper error information back to users. For example, if contract A calls contract B, and B fails in message validation (say, invalid sender). No error is provided back to contract A, and so that contract can only fail with a generic error: \"Submessage X call failed\". A specific case of this can be found in https://github.com/osmosis-labs/affiliate-swap. \r\n\r\nAdding this feature would allow any module to provide context information to users in case of errors. \r\n\r\nThe tradeoff is having to ensure events are copied to the parent context when a CacheContext is discarded\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nGive cache CacheContext a `writeErrorEvents()` (or similar) function that allows the caller to decide if those should be kept.\r\n\r\nThis would need to be properly handled in runTxs and and runMsgs in baseapp, but then each module can decide if they want to provide error-events for context or not.  \r\n","number":16174,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature]: Allow failing messages to emit error-events","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/16174"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgJ_piQ","labels":["T:feature-request","C:server/v2"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16522"],"priority ":"High","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","size":"Medium (2-3 Weeks)","status":"üìã Backlog","title":"[Feature]: Allow failing messages to emit error-events"},{"assignees":["tac0turtle","julienrbrt"],"content":{"body":"This is an automatic backport of pull request #18042 done by [Mergify](https://mergify.com).\n\n\n---\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Mergify commands and options</summary>\n\n<br />\n\nMore conditions and actions can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.mergify.com/).\n\nYou can also trigger Mergify actions by commenting on this pull request:\n\n- `@Mergifyio refresh` will re-evaluate the rules\n- `@Mergifyio rebase` will rebase this PR on its base branch\n- `@Mergifyio update` will merge the base branch into this PR\n- `@Mergifyio backport <destination>` will backport this PR on `<destination>` branch\n\nAdditionally, on Mergify [dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com) you can:\n\n- look at your merge queues\n- generate the Mergify configuration with the config editor.\n\nFinally, you can contact us on https://mergify.com\n</details>","number":18208,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"refactor(x/authz): extend validate genesis (backport #18042)","type":"PullRequest","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/18208"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKGe9g","labels":["C:x/authz"],"repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","reviewers":["sdk-core-dev"],"status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"refactor(x/authz): extend validate genesis (backport #18042)"},{"assignees":["facundomedica"],"content":{"body":"This is an automatic backport of pull request #17352 done by [Mergify](https://mergify.com).\nCherry-pick of 658a88a30991d05ae6386f21834a4058584ab863 has failed:\n```\nOn branch mergify/bp/release/v0.47.x/pr-17352\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/release/v0.47.x'.\n\nYou are currently cherry-picking commit 658a88a30.\n  (fix conflicts and run \"git cherry-pick --continue\")\n  (use \"git cherry-pick --skip\" to skip this patch)\n  (use \"git cherry-pick --abort\" to cancel the cherry-pick operation)\n\nChanges to be committed:\n\tmodified:   math/int.go\n\tmodified:   math/int_test.go\n\nUnmerged paths:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to mark resolution)\n\tboth modified:   math/CHANGELOG.md\n\n```\n\n\nTo fix up this pull request, you can check it out locally.

Though, it has a fixed workflows for every proposal.\r\n\r\n- The workflow of a gov proposal can be divided in a few steps below:\r\n\r\n    1. Proposal submission: Proposal is submitted to the blockchain with a deposit.\r\n    2. Vote: Once deposit reaches a certain value (`MinDeposit`), proposal is confirmed and vote opens. Vote options here include Yes, No, Abstain and No with Veto.\r\n    3. Tally: Once voting period ends. The gov module will tally all the votes and output a tally result. The tally result will be `passed` if the `quorum` and yes threshold is reached.\r\n    4. Execution: If the tally result of the proposal is `passed`, the execution logic for the proposal is triggered.\r\n- Note that the execution logic is different for each proposal type.\r\n\r\nNow let‚Äôs look at how to implement optimistic proposal and multiple choice proposal.\r\n\r\n### Optimistic proposal\r\n\r\n- Optimistic proposal is described as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnder Optimistic Voting, proposals pass by default after\r\n\r\nthe predetermined voting period unless vetoed above a \r\ngiven threshold by token holders (both the voting period \r\nand veto threshold will be predetermined by token \r\nholders). If the \"veto threshold\" is met, the vote is \r\nrejected and moves to the Standard Proposal voting \r\nprocess. If the \"veto threshold\" is not met, the proposal \r\npasses and can be enacted by a pre-authorized entity. \r\n```\r\n- From the description, we can sketch out the workflow of optimistic proposal:\r\n\r\n    1. Proposal submission: The proposal is submited by a whitelisted address with a deposit.\r\n    2. Vote: Once deposit reaches a certain value (`MinDeposit`), proposal is confirmed and vote opens. The only vote option is Veto.\r\n    3. Tally: Once voting period ends, all the votes are tallied. The tally result will be `passed` if veto threshold is not met.\r\n    4. Execution: If the tally result of the proposal is `passed`, the execution logic for proposal is triggered, else the proposal will be moved to step 2 of the normal workflow.\r\n- Apparently, optimistic proposal can‚Äôt be implemented as a new unique proposal type (like community fund proposal, text proposal etc) because we can only customize the execution logic not the fixed workflow. Hence, we need to redesign the gov module so that many different workflow is supported. This allows the gov module to be much more versatile as proposal can choose to be processed with the workflow that suits its purpose.\r\n\r\n- The optimistic workflow is adaptable for every existing proposals as it can handle all type of proposal with binary output.\r\n\r\n### Multiple choice proposal\r\n\r\n- Similarly, multiple choice proposal needs a different workflow than the normal workflow because of the differences in the vote, tally and execution step. This means it cannot be implemented as a proposal type.\r\n\r\n- Multiple choice proposal also shouldn‚Äôt be implemented as a workflow like the optimistic because:\r\n\r\n    - Unlike optimistic proposal, this workflow isn‚Äôt adaptable by any of the current proposal types as they‚Äôre are binary proposal.\r\n    - There should be a clear seperation between binary and multiple choice proposal. The two are inherently different from each other, if one is multiple choice it cannot be binary and vice versa.\r\n\r\n- Therefore, we should make multiple choice proposal into an entirely new archtype to be distinguished with the current binary proposal. The multiple choice archtype has the following characteristic:\r\n\r\n    - The vote is customizable for each proposal of the multiple choice archtype. Example: If I submit a multiple choice text proposal, I can customize the votes for my proposal.\r\n\r\n    - The tally result is dependent on how the votes is defines meaning a proposal can have many possible tally result instead of just `passed` or `failed`\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\n- I propose we redesign the gov module so that there‚Äôre two archtype of proposal, one is binary the other is multiple choice.\r\n- For each of the archtype, there could be many workflows to handle proposals of that archtype. Every proposal belong to the archtype can freely choose whatever workflow that suitable. Example: A binary text proposal can choose either optimistic workflow or the normal workflow cuz both workflows are for binary proposals.","number":17781,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Additional features for gov module","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/17781"},"end":"2023-12-13","id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKmXrY","labels":["C:x/gov","T:feature-request"],"priority ":"Medium","project":"Gov","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","start":"2023-11-13","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"üëë Epic","title":"Additional features for gov module"},{"assignees":["julienrbrt"],"content":{"body":"","id":"DI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgEguUw","title":"ADR Optimistic Proposal","type":"DraftIssue"},"end":"2023-11-22","id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKmYOo","priority ":"High","project":"Gov","start":"2023-11-15","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"ADR Optimistic Proposal"},{"assignees":["julienrbrt"],"content":{"body":"","id":"DI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgEgubE","title":"ADR Multiple Choice","type":"DraftIssue"},"end":"2023-11-29","id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKmYb8","priority ":"High","project":"Gov","start":"2023-11-23","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"ADR Multiple Choice"},{"assignees":["tac0turtle","julienrbrt"],"content":{"body":"- [ ] Proposal type optimistic Proposals\n- [ ] Voting \n- [ ] Documentation\n- [ ] Testing\n\nCloses: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/12824","id":"DI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgEgudc","title":"Optimistic Proposal Implmentation","type":"DraftIssue"},"end":"2023-12-09","id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKmYgs","priority ":"Medium","project":"Gov","start":"2023-12-02","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"Optimistic Proposal Implmentation"},{"assignees":["julienrbrt","tac0turtle"],"content":{"body":"- [ ] Proposal type for multiple choice\n- [ ] Voting \n- [ ] Documentation\n- [ ] Testing","id":"DI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgEgudw","title":"Multiple Choice Voting","type":"DraftIssue"},"end":"2023-12-18","id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKmYhw","priority ":"Medium","project":"Gov","start":"2023-12-09","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"Multiple Choice Voting"},{"content":{"body":"","id":"DI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgEgupk","title":"Wallet Integration Coordination","type":"DraftIssue"},"end":"2023-12-28","id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKmZAQ","priority ":"Low","project":"Gov","start":"2023-12-19","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"Wallet Integration Coordination"},{"content":{"body":"<!-- < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < ‚ò∫ \r\nv                            ‚ú∞  Thanks for opening an issue! ‚ú∞    \r\nv    Before smashing the submit button please review the template.\r\nv    Word of caution: poorly thought-out proposals may be rejected \r\nv                     without deliberation \r\n‚ò∫ > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > >  -->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently the API server needs to get the chain-id when its being started.

Estimation does not take into consideration state writes\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// Safety check: don't write the cache state unless we're in DeliverTx.\r\nif mode != runTxModeDeliver {\r\n\treturn result\r\n}\r\n\r\n// only update state if all messages pass\r\nif result.IsOK() {\r\n\tmsCache.Write() // <= this is where I believe most of the difference comes from\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. State mutations may have occurred between gas estimation and tx execution which could cause a slight deviation from the estimate. This is exacerbated if the time is increased between estimation and broadcasting/execution.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the `gas-adjustment` option exists to multiply this estimate by some factor to account for the delta.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `gas-adjustment` can become cumbersome for clients and may have to constantly change because of (1) requiring them to constantly adjust with new values (or use very large gas and pay the fees to avoid headache).\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nThere is not much we can do about (2) hence I propose we keep the `gas-adjustment` option. However, I propose we can remove (1) and make estimation nearly exact. I believe this can easily be done by introducing a third volatile yet ephemeral state in `BaseApp` -- `simulateState`.\r\n\r\nDuring `runTxModeSimulate`, we create this `simulateState` based off of the `checkState` and cache-wrap it. This will allow us to call `Write()` and get a nearly true estimation. In addition, this is pretty trivial to implement.\r\n\r\nThis is mainly a brain dump and I'm not 100% sure this works but I don't immediately see a reason why it should not work.\r\n\r\n/cc @faboweb \r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n#### For Admin Use\r\n\r\n- [x] Not duplicate issue\r\n- [x] Appropriate labels applied\r\n- [ ] Appropriate contributors tagged\r\n- [ ] Contributor assigned/self-assigned\r\n","number":4938,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Tx Gas Estimation Improvement","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4938"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKo1QQ","labels":["C:baseapp","T: UX","C:Store"],"priority ":"Low","project":"Server","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","title":"Tx Gas Estimation Improvement"},{"content":{"body":"<!-- < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < ‚ò∫ \r\nv                            ‚ú∞  Thanks for opening an issue! ‚ú∞    \r\nv    Before smashing the submit button please review the template.\r\nv    Word of caution: poorly thought-out proposals may be rejected \r\nv                     without deliberation \r\n‚ò∫ > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > >  -->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThrough the `GasMeter` charges gas costs per read regardless if that read hits the cache or not of the subseqent `KVStore`.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (gs *Store) Get(key []byte) (value []byte) {\r\n\tgs.gasMeter.ConsumeGas(gs.gasConfig.ReadCostFlat, types.GasReadCostFlatDesc)\r\n\tvalue = gs.parent.Get(key)\r\n\r\n\t// TODO overflow-safe math?\r\n\tgs.gasMeter.ConsumeGas(gs.gasConfig.ReadCostPerByte*types.Gas(len(value)), types.GasReadPerByteDesc)\r\n\r\n\treturn value\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal and more economical to either not charge at all for cache hits or have parameterized costs for cache hits (i.e. charge much less).\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nTo not charge at all would be to simply update the `KVStore` interface to have `Get` return `([]byte, ok)` where the boolean signifies if there is a cache hit or not.

The generation of this hash and proof is quite cumbersome in my opinion. We should remove generic structure names in the generation of this hash/proof with more specific types which are done for only this purpose and thus can have great restriction/optimization (it is unclear if these generic types are reused for other purposes)\r\n\r\n## Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe generation of the root hash does some unnecessary/complicated steps before asking tendermint to generate the root hash and proof. \r\n\r\nOur top level commit, has a list of kvstores and the value of each kvstore is a hash of its contents (generated via iavl). We then call this [function](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/7781cdb3d20bc7ebac017452897ce1e6ab3903ef/store/types/commit_info.go#L36), converting the list of commit id's (which contains hashes) to a golang map. This step seems completely unnecessary (explained further). Then this is turned into a [simple map](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/7781cdb3d20bc7ebac017452897ce1e6ab3903ef/store/internal/maps/maps.go#L187-#L197), and turned back into a sorted list of byte slices. The sorting here is not by the value of the byte slice, but of the kv store keys before generating the byte slice\r\n\r\ncommit stores -> sorted array kvstore hashes -> turn into golang map -> turn into simple map -> turn into partially sorted array\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The value is [prehashed](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/7781cdb3d20bc7ebac017452897ce1e6ab3903ef/store/internal/maps/maps.go#L99) before included in the root hash. Also note, the value is already a hash of the kvstore, so we have prehash(hash) which is used in constructing the root hash. The simple map implementation seems to indicate this is a potential caching optimization, but that is not the reasoning from a correctness standpoint and would break verification algorithms if removed (without also updating the ics23 spec)!\r\n\r\nAlso note that the []byte provided in [][]byte is not the hash of the kvstore but the leaf value which is `len(key)  + key + len(prehash(kvstore.hash)) + prehash(kvstore.hash)`, see ics23 [prepareLeafData](https://github.com/confio/ics23/blob/a4daeb4c24ce1be827829c0841446abc690c4f11/go/ops.go#L92)\r\n\r\nThe documentation is [incorrect](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/7781cdb3d20bc7ebac017452897ce1e6ab3903ef/store/internal/maps/maps.go#L75). The [tendermint ics23 spec](https://github.com/confio/ics23/blob/a4daeb4c24ce1be827829c0841446abc690c4f11/go/proof.go#L28) does not prehash the key\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nA new structure can be used, but it should have a specific name like `multistoreRoothashConstructor` or something like that. \r\n\r\nIt should, take in a list of [store infos](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/7781cdb3d20bc7ebac017452897ce1e6ab3903ef/store/types/commit_info.pb.go#L28) (sort by key - maybe add a wrapper for store info or util func), it should then, construct a [][]byte array where each []byte is `len(key) + key + len(prehash_value) + prehash(kvstore.hash)`. Then pass this into [`merkle.ProofsFromByteSlices`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/7781cdb3d20bc7ebac017452897ce1e6ab3903ef/store/internal/maps/maps.go#L199)\r\n\r\nI highly recommend feeling comfortable with how the root hash is constructed before taking on this issue","number":13534,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"remove simple map usage for multistore roothash/proof creation","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/13534"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKo1TM","labels":["C:Store"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/18944"],"priority ":"Low","project":"Store","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"remove simple map usage for multistore roothash/proof creation"},{"assignees":["tac0turtle","testinginprod"],"content":{"body":"","number":17576,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Move Relevant Types to Core","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/17576"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKo1aQ","labels":["C:Store"],"need":"Required","priority ":"High","project":"Store","releases":"Olympus ‚õà","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"Move Relevant Types to Core"},{"content":{"body":"<!-- < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < ‚ò∫ \r\nv                            ‚ú∞  Thanks for opening an issue! ‚ú∞    \r\nv    Before smashing the submit button please review the template.\r\nv    Word of caution: poorly thought-out proposals may be rejected \r\nv                     without deliberation \r\n‚ò∫ > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > >  --> \r\n## Summary\r\nWe currently charge for all allocated gas, even if it was unused. This creates a tension between the amount gas simulation tells you you need, and the overhead you allow in case some state change makes you have to spend a bit more in order for your tx to remain in everyones mempool. We should refund in some capacity the allocated gas that wasn't used, as that incurred no cost to each node on the network. (Though it may have had some affect on block building -- more on that in the following)\r\n\r\n## Problem Definition\r\n### Why do we need this feature\r\nI think it is going to be unnecessary extra decision / mental overhead of figuring out how much gas to use. (Do you use exactly the minimum which simulation says, and risk it not being propagated, do you do some multiplicative adjustment and just take the cost, do you try to use whats default and not worry about the money your inadvertently burning) This sort of decision fatigue is a serious concern, and may end up driving normal people away from the network. (Or at the very least, cause them to burn extra money which I think is bad)\r\n\r\n### What Ethereum does\r\nDue to other design choices Ethereum has made, they only charge for the gas used, not gas allocated. (By refunding, but they cap refunds at 50% of provided gas limit, src: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale#gas-and-fees) I haven't been able to find a source online which indicates if they use gas allocated vs gas refunded to account for the block gas limit though. \r\n\r\nHowever this means in the current model this is mental overhead our users have that they wouldn't have on other similar cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\n### Problems that arise \r\nThe \"Naive\" solution of refund all unused gas has problems. An adversary could just set their allocated tx gas to be a large number, preventing other txs from getting into the block at no cost. \r\n\r\n<!-- Why do we need this feature? \r\nWhat problems may be addressed by introducing this feature?\r\nWhat benefits does the SDK stand to gain by including this feature?\r\nAre there any disadvantages of including this feature? -->\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n<!-- Detailed description of requirements of implementation --> \r\n### Proposed solution to adversarially increasing gas allocated\r\nI think this should be resolved with 2 mitigation techniques:\r\n1) Limit the percentage refunded (what Ethereum does), this means the multiplicative factor by which a tx can overallocate gas is limited. (e.g. 1.5, or 2). `gas_charged = max(gas_used, gas_wanted / 2)`\r\n2) Have the default mempool priority function be dependent on gas. So even if you overestimate your gas, you still have to increase your fee by some extent for network propagation / block inclusion. (Ref #2275 for priority function)\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\nWe currently have no \"EndTx\" (AFAICT), so we can refund the gas in endblock. (We can append pointers to the gas meters in a linked list thats cached in the context, and empty this linked list / array in EndBlock)\r\n\r\nWe don't need to worry about the percentage operations taking lots of computation time, as they are on pure int64s. (We may even be able to do some stuff with SIMD as well)\r\n\r\nI think this is something we should do soon after mempool sorting postlaunch.\r\n/cc @cwgoes \r\n____\r\n#### For Admin Use\r\n - [X] Not duplicate issue\r\n - [X] Appropriate labels applied\r\n - [ ] Appropriate contributors tagged\r\n - [ ] Contributor assigned/self-assigned\r\n","number":2150,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Refunding unused but allocated gas","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/2150"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKo2bM","labels":["S:proposed","C: gas"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8993"],"priority ":"High","project":"Server","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"‚òÉÔ∏è Icebox","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"Refunding unused but allocated gas"},{"content":{"body":"## Summary\r\nPut a telemetry for every message to measure average processing time.\r\n\r\n## Problem Definition\r\nAs a developer building blockchain with cosmos-sdk, they want to know what operation makes blockchain slow.\r\n\r\nIf cosmos-sdk support `gauge telemetry` for each message in the transaction, It helps us to find out which transaction degrades the overall performance on early stage in development.","number":13981,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Measure average time consumed per each `Message`","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/13981"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKo3dc","labels":["C:baseapp","T: Performance","C:Store"],"priority ":"Low","project":"Server","quarter":"Q3","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","sprint":"true","status":"üìã Backlog","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"Measure average time consumed per each `Message`"},{"assignees":["kocubinski"],"content":{"body":"As benchmarking has been a key piece of work within the SC with the process of choosing the implementation (current IAVL, memIAVL, IAVL v1)\r\n\r\nFor more information on the benchmarking that has been currently done: \r\nhttps://github.com/kocubinski/iavl-bench\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\r\n###\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/17580\r\n- [ ] Pruning impl for iavl v1\r\n- [ ] RMS that ties in SC SS for benchmarking\r\n```\r\n","number":17578,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Benchmarking for SC","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/17578"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKo5ME","labels":["C:Store"],"priority ":"Medium","project":"Store","releases":"Olympus ‚õà","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"Benchmarking for SC"},{"assignees":["alexanderbez"],"content":{"body":"","number":18462,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Implement PebbleDB Pruning and Fixes","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18462"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKo5nM","labels":["C:Store"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/18459"],"priority ":"High","project":"Store","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","size":"Medium (2-3 Weeks)","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"üëë Epic","title":"Implement PebbleDB Pruning and Fixes"},{"assignees":["alexanderbez"],"content":{"body":"","number":18463,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Store: Export Metrics","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18463"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKo_tU","labels":["C:Store"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/18529"],"priority ":"Medium","project":"Store","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"Store: Export Metrics"},{"content":{"body":"","number":18464,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Commit SS and SC Async","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18464"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKo_u4","labels":["C:Store"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19313"],"need":"Nice To Have","priority ":"High","project":"Store","releases":"Olympus ‚õà","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"Commit SS and SC Async"},{"assignees":["alexanderbez"],"content":{"body":"","number":18465,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Reevaluate Storage v2 ADR","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18465"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKo_wQ","labels":["C:Store"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/18862"],"priority ":"Low","project":"Store","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"Reevaluate Storage v2 ADR"},{"content":{"body":"<!-- < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < ‚ò∫ \r\nv                            ‚ú∞  Thanks for opening an issue!

Should it live in the docs? In the glossary?\r\n\r\n## Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe chainid registry has a prefix for cosmos chains that is followed by the chain id as a suffix. They enforce a chain id with the case-sensitive pattern `[-a-zA-Z0-9]{3,47}`. If it does not follow this pattern they hash the chain-id and include a `cosmos-hash` prefix instead of the `cosmos` prefix. Apparently out of all cosmos chains currently live none of them violate their requirements (which is great!). In order to help maintain the human readable version of their standard it would be good to recommend (or even enforce to a certain degree) chain id formats that follow their recommendations.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nOne or both of the following:\r\n * List this chain id format under best practices somewhere in the documentation.\r\n * Enforce the chain id to follow this standard within the genesis file and/or within the command line. Alternatively it could simply notify the user that their id does not comply and ask if they are sure they want to use it anyway.\r\n<!-- Detailed description of requirements of implementation -->\r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n#### For Admin Use\r\n\r\n- [ ] Not duplicate issue\r\n- [ ] Appropriate labels applied\r\n- [ ] Appropriate contributors tagged\r\n- [ ] Contributor assigned/self-assigned\r\n","number":5363,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"chain-id best practices","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5363"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKpCfg","labels":["T:Docs"],"priority ":"High","quarter":"Q3","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","size":"Small (1 Week)","status":"üìã Backlog","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"chain-id best practices"},{"assignees":["testinginprod"],"content":{"body":"This issue is to mainly track the requirements needed in order to integrate store v2 into the wider SDK framework.

Querying all blocks in the signing window for some validators (e.g. kujiravaloper1pshqems6hdka48gc56r2ykshyaarkt40hl0rlh) shows no misses while `kujirad query slashing signing-info` reports a positive count.\r\n\r\nI believe the issue is here: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/23576d3d49de3be415bf8c55fbf4c67ea690875b/x/slashing/keeper/infractions.go#L23-L49\r\n\r\nThis code updates the missed block count by checking the current value against the previous value at that index. The problem is any blocks missed at indexes above 18000 in the bit array are \"lost\" when the window changes because they'll contribute to the count but never be checked again. That explains the behavior we're seeing where multiple validators have miss counts that won't go below where they were on 7/3 when the parameter change took effect.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n<!-- git commit hash or release version -->\r\nv0.45.4\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!-- What commands in order should someone run to reproduce your problem? -->\r\nCause a validator to miss blocks distributed throughout the slashing window and then lower the slashing window parameter for the chain. Compare manual missed block counts from checking signatures against what's reported by `query slashing signing-info`. \r\n____\r\n\r\n## For Admin Use\r\n\r\n- [ ] Not duplicate issue\r\n- [ ] Appropriate labels applied\r\n- [ ] Appropriate contributors tagged\r\n- [ ] Contributor assigned/self-assigned\r\n","number":12541,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Validator missed blocks count is incorrect after decreasing slashing window","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/12541"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKsB0I","labels":["T:Bug","C:x/slashing"],"priority ":"Medium","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"‚òÉÔ∏è Icebox","story Type":"üêû Bug","title":"Validator missed blocks count is incorrect after decreasing slashing window"},{"content":{"body":"<!-- < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < ‚ò∫ \r\nv                            ‚ú∞  Thanks for opening an issue! ‚ú∞    \r\nv    Before smashing the submit button please review the template.\r\nv    Please also ensure that this is not a duplicate issue :)  \r\n‚ò∫ > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > >  -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIMPORTANT: Prior to opening a bug report, check if it affects one of the core modules\r\nand if its elegible for a bug bounty on `SECURITY.md`.

In other words: getContextForProposal, doesn‚Äôt return the correct context when height == 0. Also this causes an undesired re-set of state in `ProcessProposal`\r\n\r\n\r\nOn tests:\r\n- On many tests ProcessProposal is not being called, we call FinalizeBlock directly which is not compatible with ABCI++.

I presume they got jailed and slashed due to not acting in accordance with the liveness expectations of the bridge, i.e. signing validator set updates, etc...\r\n\r\nIn any case, when the validator attempts to successfully unjail and then attempts a delegation or redelegation to themselves, they receive the following error:\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nError: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = recovered: calculated final stake for delegator <REDACTED> greater than current stake\r\n        final stake:    9905000000.000000000000000000\r\n        current stake:  9895095000.000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich comes from this block: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/9fd866e3820b3510010ae172b682d71594cd8c14/x/distribution/keeper/delegation.go#L96-L132\r\n\r\nI recall when working on this long ago with @rigelrozanski, that we knew there could be certain cases where there might be \"off by one\" issues, but very very unlikely. This is unfortunate as we've seen this issue for several validators and essentially make delegating to them impossible after they're unjailed.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nv0.43.0 (also applicable on v0.44)\r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n## For Admin Use\r\n\r\n- [ ] Not duplicate issue\r\n- [ ] Appropriate labels applied\r\n- [ ] Appropriate contributors tagged\r\n- [ ] Contributor assigned/self-assigned\r\n","number":10091,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Failure to (re)delegate after validator jailed & slashed","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/10091"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKsFqk","labels":["T:Bug","C:x/staking","C:x/slashing"],"priority ":"Medium","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","story Type":"üêû Bug","title":"Failure to (re)delegate after validator jailed & slashed"},{"assignees":["lucaslopezf"],"content":{"body":"<!-- < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < < ‚ò∫ \r\nv                            ‚ú∞  Thanks for opening an issue! ‚ú∞    \r\nv    Before smashing the submit button please review the template.\r\nv    Please also ensure that this is not a duplicate issue :)  \r\n‚ò∫ > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > >  -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIMPORTANT: Prior to opening a bug report, check if it affects one of the core modules\r\nand if its elegible for a bug bounty on `SECURITY.md`.

Delegate some tokens to a validator\r\n2. Unbond/redelegate those tokens to another validator. \r\n\r\nSometimes, it might happen that the chain stores a delegation entry with `amount` equals to `0` but with a non-empty `shares` amount.

However, for certain actors such as security service providers or active validators, granting unlimited time tripping may be too powerful, raising concerns in the community.\r\n\r\nIntroducing expirations introduces another lever that will make the Circuit module more effective and decentralized. For most incident situations, a security provider could trip specific message types for a limited amount of time, which would give enough time for parties with \"more authority,\" such as the core team or an expedited gov proposal, to review the situation and potentially trip the message for a longer time.\r\n\r\nThere is no disadvantage to adding this feature beyond the added complexity to the permissions system.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nTo handle the expired untripping of a circuit, the most efficient option would be to execute the business logic to untrip a circuit upon evaluation if the timespan has passed. The other option would be to handle circuit untripping in the `BeforeBlock` and `EndBlock` stages of IBC modules.\r\n\r\nThere are two approaches for handling the amount of time a circuit is tripped, detailed below.\r\n\r\n****************************************1: No Expiration****************************************\r\n\r\nThis would extend the current implementation, allowing one to optionally specify the amount of time that the circuit should be tripped for. If no time is specified, then the circuit remains tripped in perpetuity.\r\n\r\n******************************************************2: Default Expiration Times******************************************************\r\n\r\nThis approach would automatically assign a sensible amount of time to tripped circuits (i.e., 24 hours), requiring one to override the time explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Improved Permission Levels\r\n\r\nAn additional improvement would be to expand the permission levels to allow for specifying an upper bound to the timespan a circuit can be tripped for certain permission levels (ie, super admin can specify any timespan, other permissions capped at 24 hours).\r\n\r\n## Implementation Examples\r\n\r\nTo accommodate this feature, the `DisabledList` field will need to be changed to a `[collections.Map]` type or a new field introduced, which allows for mapping values to a key (message url).\r\n\r\nEach key (message url) should map to an object that allows specifying expiration time and a list of addresses that are allowed to bypass the tripped circuit. An example of this is included below:\r\n\r\nAn implementation of the ‚Äúdeny by default‚Äù multi-address blocklist is given below, which would allow any signer included in the `BypassSet` to send a message regardless of whether or not the circuit is tripped.\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype FilteredUrl struct {\r\n   BypassSet collections.KeySet[string]\r\n\t ExpiresAt i64\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn updated `AnteHandle` method of the circuit breaker is listed below, with comments indicating the changed behavior.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (cbd CircuitBreakerDecorator) AnteHandle(ctx sdk.Context, tx sdk.Tx, simulate bool, next sdk.AnteHandler) (sdk.Context, error) {\r\n  //  pseudocode, need to actually parse the transaction object to retrieve the signer\r\n  signer := tx.GetSigners()\r\n\t// loop through all the messages and check if the message type is allowed\r\n\tfor _, msg := range tx.GetMsgs() {\r\n\r\n\t\t// lookup message url in circuit breaker to see if it is tripped\r\n\r\n\t\t// if circuit is tripped, check to see if an expiration time is associated with the circuit\r\n\r\n\t\t// if there is an expiration time and it has passed untrip the circuit, and break out of loop\r\n\r\n\t\t// if there is an expiration time and it has not passed, or there is no expiration time\r\n\t\t// check to see if the signer is allowed to bypass the tripped circuit\r\n\r\n\t\t// circuit is tripped, signer can't bypass, return error\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn next(ctx, tx, simulate)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthor: @bonedaddy Co-author: @aesmonty","number":18402,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature]: Trip Circuit with Expiration","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18402"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKt4RA","labels":["T:feature-request"],"priority ":"Low","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","title":"[Feature]: Trip Circuit with Expiration"},{"content":{"body":"Some enhancements should happen in Hubl before the official release.\r\n\r\n- [ ] First, the keyring story works but could be more intuitive.

Thus, the order in which txs were verified on ingress was the exact same order when they were proposed.\r\n\r\n`CheckTx`, and as a result `runTx`, currently executes _sequentially_ incoming txs on a `stateCheckTx`, which accumulates state changes over successive txs, 1-by-1.

For example, Stargaze's recent upgrade listed the upgrade version as v11 but the tag is really v11.0.0. Another issue that can arise is, when multiple versions are listed in the description, like what else the upgrade is updating to, determining the proper version tag for GitHub is not reliable.\r\n\r\nI believe this will help many with upgrades.

Much of the ecosystem has become accustom to this method, but it has caused a growth in maintenance from application developers.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if you would like to sync from genesis then it is a mess to get all the right versions lined up in cosmovisor, even then its its unclear if the binaries will work as intended, barring there was no emergency binary issued by the team. This leads to many people not being able to sync from genesis on newer chains. \r\n\r\n_Note: If the node operators have archives nodes, then it is not possible to allow querying of old versions through the running binary. Secondary or third binaries need to be provided in order to query the old state._ \r\n\r\nFor the reasons listed above and those not listed, we would like to explore rolling upgrades. \r\n\r\nA rolling upgrade is when node operators can upgrade binaries ahead of time allowing the chain to upgrade on its own without intervention by the developers or node operators. This will simplify the operation of a node, allow node operators to sync from genesis and will allow historical versions to be run without needing to operate many different binaries. \r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\nThe goals of this work are:\r\n\r\n- Minimal Downtime: Networks should be upgradable with minimal or no downtime sustained to its users\r\n- Backwards Compatibility: Allow node operators the option to query historical state and process historical transactions. If holding onto older versions of the app proves to have a performance overhead we should allow operators to only compile the latest version of the app. \n\n### Problem Definition\n\nUpgrades are cumbersome for node operators, from being awake at all hours of the day for an upgrade to making sure you upgrade at the correct time. Application developers have a larger burden to maintain historical binaries and hope that the block protocol will not change from version to version. \r\n\n\n### Work Breakdown\n\nAs we have adopted protobuf in the Cosmos SDK there are some gotchas with how this can be done. \r\n\r\nWe should work on a few demos in different directions for how to achieve many different app versions. This will help influence the final design. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is meant as a tracking issue and will be updated once we are ready to begin this work.","number":18523,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Epic]: Rolling Upgrades","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18523"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKxMDw","labels":["C:x/upgrade","T:Epic"],"repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","size":"X-Large (6+ weeks)","status":"‚òÉÔ∏è Icebox","story Type":"üëë Epic","title":"[Epic]: Rolling Upgrades"},{"assignees":["samricotta"],"content":{"body":"Setting up a preliminary tutorials tab to link to individual tutorials to be able to insert new tutorials in easily\r\n\r\nPart of #84 ","number":89,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk-docs","title":"refactor: Update tutorials","type":"PullRequest","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk-docs/pull/89"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgKzHW4","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk-docs","reviewers":["tac0turtle","julienrbrt"],"status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"refactor: Update tutorials"},{"assignees":["testinginprod"],"content":{"body":"Currently unknown proto implementation relies on gogo generator types, this is not required since we could simply be using the official descriptorpb package.

This package is useful for commands and for interacting with state machine from Go. The issue has become that there is no separation between state machine and client code. This has caused issues when users try to import the client package, they get the whole sdk with it too, and client has bled into the state machine. This is evident with things like `client.Context` being using in the server package because it was available. \r\n\r\nThis Epic is focused on the package client/v2.

This is a very helpful tool for the risk team of the venue to have. \r\n\r\nGiven that parameter changes on DEXes typically require an extended voting period, this isn't possible. In some cases DEXes have tried to work around this by whitelisting a centralized operator who can adjust these risk parameters in real time. This isn't an ideal solution in all cases, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nApart from chains built around trading, I could see a desire for strictly risk-reducing votes to be treated differently than generic votes. For example, I could imagine that all chains might benefit from allowing a message to halt withdrawals to proceed fast in the event of a hack.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nThe components that I see for this might be:\r\n\r\n1) A taxonomy of messages or vote actions. Chains would be able to specify that a vote to _increase_ parameter `x` is in the `safe` group but a vote to _decrease_ `x` is in the `default` group, for example.\r\n\r\n2) A way to specify the rules for each group of actions. `safe` actions might require only 20% quorum, have no minimum vote period and require a different deposit whereas `default` actions would have whatever the default requirements are.","number":18595,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature]: Message-Dependent Governance Vote Parameters","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18595"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgK_W60","labels":["C:x/gov","T:feature-request"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19101"],"need":"Required","project":"Gov","releases":"Olympus ‚õà","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","size":"Large (3-6 weeks)","status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"[Feature]: Message-Dependent Governance Vote Parameters"},{"assignees":["cool-develope"],"content":{"body":"We need to support an `SetInitialVersion(v uint64)` on the `Tree` (SC) interface.","number":18597,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Support SetInitialVersion in SC","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18597"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgK_fcc","labels":["C:Store"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/18665"],"priority ":"Medium","project":"Store","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"Support SetInitialVersion in SC"},{"assignees":["cool-develope"],"content":{"body":"## Context\r\n\r\nThe `GetProof` is not fully reflected the proof of multi store structure.

There are a few related problems here.\r\n1. Every time a new delegation voucher is created the LSM module increments a sequence number, resulting in a new asset. In order to send an asset over IBC you need to know the sequence number in advance. So in order to combine the creation of a delegation voucher and an IBC send this means a client needs to be smart and check what the current counter number is and increment by one. If someone happens to create a delegation voucher the moment before you did your transaction will fail. So there needs to be a reliable way to issue the delegation voucher and send together. One way this could be solved is allowing someone to \"IBC send all delegation vouchers of any kind\"\r\n2. This solution would also solve a second problem which is today one must know the exact amount of tokens you are sending  to form an IBC transaction. If you could just \"send all tokens\" you wouldn't need to worry about how many tokens your delegation shares convert to, you can simply send everything you have.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is also a related problem where transactions will fail if users assets are currently vesting. If a user could \"convert all vested shares\" into delegation vouchers and combine this with the IBC send all functionality described above then we could have a very clean 1 click experience with no edge cases.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nThe shape of a complete solution would satisfy the following function:\r\n> Convert all vested tokens into delegation shares, send all delegation shares of any kind to this IBC address\r\n\r\ncc @zmanian ","number":18892,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature]: liquid staking UX requests","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18892"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgLjbyA","labels":["T:feature-request"],"priority ":"Medium","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"‚òÉÔ∏è Icebox","title":"[Feature]: liquid staking UX requests"},{"assignees":["sontrinh16"],"content":{"body":"### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### What happened?\r\n\r\nIn trying to use the `NewIntegrationApp` helper to test a module I noticed that the state written by `InitChain` sourced from `DefaultGenesis` is not written to state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cosmos SDK Version\r\n\r\nmain\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce?\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, run a modified `Example_oneModule` from https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/tests/integration/example/example_test.go#L119\r\n\r\nSee this PR/commit for a minimal repro:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/silasdavis/cosmos-sdk/pull/1\r\n\r\nIn that commit I have removed the part of the test that calls `RunMsg` to set the the params with `MaxMemoCharacters` changed to 1000.\r\n\r\nI would expect to see the params take their default values.\r\n\r\nInstead of observing params that take on the values set by `DefaultGenesis` you see that the params take on the zero value of the `Params` struct, indicating that the `InitChain` is not writing the initial genesis state to the underlying IAVL tree.","number":18910,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Bug]: NewIntegrationApp does not write default genesis to state","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18910"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgLlVE8","labels":["T:Bug"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/21006"],"priority ":"Medium","quarter":"Q3","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","split":"false","sprint":"true","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"üêû Bug","title":"[Bug]: NewIntegrationApp does not write default genesis to state"},{"assignees":["facundomedica","julienrbrt","atheeshp"],"content":{"body":"# Description\r\n\r\nCloses: #18781\r\n\r\n<!-- Add a description of the changes that this PR introduces and the files that\r\nare the most critical to review. -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Author Checklist\r\n\r\n*All items are required.

We should do that. (20% speed reduction)\r\n- We only make the btree inside CacheKV if we need it. Its always made here:  https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk/blob/osmo/v0.47.5/store/cachekv/store.go#L40-L42 (and/or only make the map's if we need them) I suspect 75% or more of the btree's are unused. So if we did this for just btree's (easy) its a 18% saving.

The goal is to reset `GasMeter` instead of `BlockGasMeter`. So shouldn't we be using `withGasMeter` instead of `withBlockGasMeter` [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/baseapp/abci.go#L757)?\r\n2. It‚Äôs probably better to move the reset code into the for loop [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/baseapp/abci.go#L797). This helps guarantee that `GasMeter` for each tx are independent and don't affect each other. The same goes for `CheckTx`, the `GasMeter` could be reset [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/baseapp/abci.go#L361C1-L361C1).\r\n\r\nApart from the recommendations above. Given that the bug is found on v0.47.6, I think it makes sense to backport the fix to v0.47.x? Or are those branches no longer maintained?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the main branch was never affected by non-decodable transactions, since the check [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/baseapp/abci.go#L798) catches the error early and returns a result with `GasUsed` set to 0. Nonetheless, resetting still helps guard against other future errors within `runTx` from contaminating gas usage for subsequent txs.\n\n### Cosmos SDK Version\n\n0.47\n\n### How to reproduce?\n\n_No response_","number":18978,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Bug]: Incomplete Patch #18714","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18978"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgLwrOU","labels":["T:Bug"],"priority ":"Critical","quarter":"Q3","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","story Type":"üêû Bug","title":"[Bug]: Incomplete Patch #18714"},{"content":{"body":"ServerV2 needs less from storage compared to what BaseApp needed to do. \r\n\r\nIn fact ServerV2, opposed to BaseApp, shoulders the responsibility of:\r\n- Handling branching: branching is not SS or SC dependent, branching simply needs to be the fastest version of an in memory DB KV changes transaction. \r\n- Handling gas: gas is also SS or SC independent, which means that it simply needs to deal with metering storage tx costs.\r\n\r\nTaking these examples into consideration, the Storage API needed by AppManager is the one defined [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/fe8dd8ca749759d709aac148048f9120ab4e4921/server/v2/core/store/types.go#L12:L25), specifically:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// Store defines the underlying storage engine of an app.\r\ntype Store interface {\r\n\t// StateLatest returns a readonly view over the latest\r\n\t// committed state of the store.

The config and data directories are then children of that home directory.

The problem is that even though they have remaining staking reward, they would still have to get the token else where since they wouldn't be able to withdraw their staking reward as well (due to insufficient fees).\r\n\r\nA quick and simple solution could be done by adding a ante handler for this. The ante handler would need to go before the deduct fee decorator (https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/simapp/ante.go#L45) \r\n\r\nIf user does not have the fee to broadcast the transaction, this ante handler would check if the user has any rewards they can use, and if so, withdraw the reward and use it as fee. We can either 1) withdraw all remaining reward or 2) withdraw the exact amount needed for fee, but don't know if 2 is possible in the current code structure.\r\n\r\nTo ensure backward compatibility, this feature would only be used when tx is passed with a specific flag for this (e.g `--use-reward`).\r\n\r\nThe only concern I have is gas, as `withdrawDelegation` method costs alot of gas right now. We need to think a way to optimize this if we were to use this in ante handler\r\n\r\nHappy to make a quick implementation and submit a PR if folks agree with the general idea / direction!\n\n### Problem Definition\n\n****\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nAs above","number":19384,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature]: Create AnteHandler for enabling using rewards for fees","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/19384"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgMjDms","labels":["T:feature-request"],"priority ":"Low","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"‚òÉÔ∏è Icebox","title":"[Feature]: Create AnteHandler for enabling using rewards for fees"},{"content":{"body":"### Summary\n\nFor performance reasons, it would be nice to have mutative versions of `MulDecTruncate` and alike\r\n\r\nref: https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/pull/7416#discussion_r1483563986\n\n### Problem Definition\n\n_No response_\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nImlement mutative version for each math method on `sdk.DecCoins`","number":19389,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature]: implement mutative methods for sdk.DecCoins","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/19389"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgMkxjQ","labels":["T:feature-request"],"priority ":"Medium","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","title":"[Feature]: implement mutative methods for sdk.DecCoins"},{"content":{"body":"This is an automatic backport of pull request #19280 done by [Mergify](https://mergify.com).\nCherry-pick of 89df28ceb9fc74f8b4b2128ebdff379089c518a8 has failed:\n```\nOn branch mergify/bp/release/v0.47.x/pr-19280\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/release/v0.47.x'.\n\nYou are currently cherry-picking commit 89df28ceb.\n  (fix conflicts and run \"git cherry-pick --continue\")\n  (use \"git cherry-pick --skip\" to skip this patch)\n  (use \"git cherry-pick --abort\" to cancel the cherry-pick operation)\n\nChanges to be committed:\n\tmodified:   server/util.go\n\nUnmerged paths:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to mark resolution)\n\tboth modified:   CHANGELOG.md\n\tboth modified:   baseapp/options.go\n\tboth modified:   server/start.go\n\n```\n\n\nTo fix up this pull request, you can check it out locally.

This causes excess time for:\r\n- Fetching this data\r\n- IAVL committing to this data\r\n\r\nIn Osmosis this is 150 to 300 state writes per block!  We see this on average being around 175 writes.\r\n\r\nWe've just started benchmarking and aiming to reduce our number of writes per block. After we changed x/distribution to only distribute staking rewards once every 50 blocks, it preliminarily looks like were at around 1000 writes per block, so this is a big contribution to database Commit time! \r\n\r\n### Problem Definition\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nRight now I'm concerned with lowering the number of writes at hand here. (But later on would like to reduce the data fetch time too)\r\n\r\nThere are two data writes right now:\r\n- We always write SlashingInfo for every validator. What this is doing right now is just incrementing an offset, and then tracking missed blocks if you changed how many you missed.\r\n- If your missed status for the current block is different than your last block at that offset, we update the bitmap.\r\n\r\nI see 3 paths forward here:\r\n- [ ] (Low Complexity)  Remove the offset incrementing in SetInfo. It just doesn't need to happen, you can derive it from a \"start offset\", and tracking the block height pretty easily. If folks are aligned with this approach I'll happily make a PR, and this should drop the number of writes to just be roughly `2 * num_missed_validator_sigs`.\r\n- [ ] (Low-Medium Complexity) Theres a lot of data locality were just kinda missing here. We could just not update liveness tracking info every single block, and instead update it every \"10\" blocks. This would require:\r\n  - Every block writing to state the list of votes (unless stored already). (NOTE: It is stored in staking)\r\n  - Every \"interval\" run the existing vote logic.\r\n    - All the data gets will be in cache improving speed\r\n    - We will only do 1 write per validator + num validator missed blocks, but the number of missed block should be in the same validator bitmap chunk, so still likely just 2 writes.\r\n- [ ] (Medium Complexity) Change the data structure so that all validator's bitmap entry's that get processed together are in the same IAVL leaf. (This would lower the read and write cost significantly, as instead of reads and writes for 150 validators, its O(1) DB reads/writes, just each capturing 150 bits of data)\r\n\r\nI think we should do both solutions (1) and (2) personally, but I see (2) as potentially contentious. (I think its fine, but I'd understand if others disagreed) I'm happy to PR a fix for #1, if other folks agree. I believe it would be:\r\n- Simple\r\n- A notable win\r\n\r\nHowever I would not be taking on the fully burdened work scope of QA'ing the migration in the mainline SDK. I would bring it to the Osmosis fork if were aligned, but I would only include it in Osmosis if the mainline SDK folks wanted to do it.","number":19457,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Performance]: Restructure slashing for more performance","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/19457"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgMxXbo","labels":["T:feature-request"],"priority ":"High","quarter":"Q3","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","sprint":"true","status":"üìã Backlog","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"[Performance]: Restructure slashing for more performance"},{"content":{"body":"Bumps [github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto) from 1.0.0-beta.2 to 1.0.0-beta.4.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/commit/c77f0ce85853e2e5405ebc67afa88953b4eccfd2\"><code>c77f0ce</code></a> chore(deps): bump google.golang.org/protobuf from 1.28.1 to 1.32.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/issues/130\">#130</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/commit/a8d943a8c26059af346ab40dedb75d8e4059c7ec\"><code>a8d943a</code></a> chore(deps): bump pgregory.net/rapid from 0.6.1 to 1.1.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/issues/122\">#122</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/commit/0204988043090cddaeb63a3f84cbc86971f90a1a\"><code>0204988</code></a> chore(deps): bump actions/setup-go from 4 to 5 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/issues/129\">#129</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/commit/805ee2444beb6f38a79b402e10c782866ee862ef\"><code>805ee24</code></a> chore: alias <code>anyutil</code> to <code>any</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/issues/132\">#132</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/commit/3f5f5eb19538f5ff023e88461fb7ca890807f5e1\"><code>3f5f5eb</code></a> chore(deps): bump amannn/action-semantic-pull-request from 5.3.0 to 5.4.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/issues/127\">#127</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/commit/b6a88f6e0255c2fb92f5d9a7211caa38769e33d5\"><code>b6a88f6</code></a> chore(deps): bump github.com/google/go-cmp from 0.5.9 to 0.6.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/issues/126\">#126</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/commit/563ad0fbf6ba04b8644513910c37a5a9e7b1a043\"><code>563ad0f</code></a> chore(deps): bump amannn/action-semantic-pull-request from 5.2.0 to 5.3.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/issues/125\">#125</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/commit/d53309abc17d2238b501de5dd402952473452541\"><code>d53309a</code></a> chore(deps): bump gotest.tools/v3 from 3.4.0 to 3.5.1 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/issues/124\">#124</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/commit/059a08a7844d886f3385d8f97d52a76558ee543c\"><code>059a08a</code></a> chore(deps): bump actions/checkout from 3 to 4 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/issues/123\">#123</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/commit/0cef9d7dcc95c8d8a2943c0747673d8f5821f882\"><code>0cef9d7</code></a> chore(deps): bump pgregory.net/rapid from 0.6.0 to 0.6.1 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/issues/115\">#115</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto/compare/v1.0.0-beta.2...v1.0.0-beta.4\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=github.com/cosmos/cosmos-proto&package-manager=go_modules&previous-version=1.0.0-beta.2&new-version=1.0.0-beta.4)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

It would specify `slash_percentage` and `validator address`.\r\n\r\n## Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThis has a number of use cases. It allows blockchain communities to codify social standards that validators have to adhere to, and in the event they are 'caught' by the community, it allows them to slash them on-chain. (Without needing a hard fork)\r\n\r\nA social slashing standard that has interest from the Osmosis community is essentially a \"No Sybilling\" condition, where they can all agree that if governance is presented with sufficiently persuasive evidence of a validator sybilling in order to game airdrops, newer staking reward designs, etc. they would be slashed for a certain factor. (With some carveout for cotenancy situations etc.). This is in part motivated by some validator-sybil-gameable decentralization ideas, cref https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/2036-proposal-per-validator-epoch-bonus-for-better-decentralization\r\n\r\nI'm generally of the view that this is important for many chains, if validators commit malicious activities not yet thought about in advance, or on other chains. I propose we add this as a governance proposal type to the slashing module. Chains can simply choose not to add this governance proposal type to their governance router if they don't want this feature.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nMake a new governance proposal type in slashing with the following proto:\r\n```\r\nmessage SlashValidator {\r\n  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = \"authority\";\r\n\r\n  string authority = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = \"cosmos.AddressString\"];\r\n  string validator_address = 2 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = \"cosmos.ValidatorAddressString\"];\r\n  string slash_factor_percent = 3 [\r\n    (cosmos_proto.scalar)  = \"cosmos.Dec\",\r\n    (gogoproto.customtype) = \"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Dec\",\r\n    (gogoproto.nullable)   = false\r\n  ];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen implement that message in slashing message server and do the authority check.\r\n\r\nEDIT(@julienrbrt):\r\n\r\n- Updated issue to match gov v1.\r\n- Higher quorum is solved by message based params (already implemented)\r\n____\r\n\r\n#### For Admin Use\r\n\r\n- [ ] Not duplicate issue\r\n- [ ] Appropriate labels applied\r\n- [ ] Appropriate contributors tagged\r\n- [ ] Contributor assigned/self-assigned\r\n","number":10917,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Make a slash governance proposal","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/10917"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgMzVSI","labels":["good first issue","C:x/slashing"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/11024"],"priority ":"Low","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"‚òÉÔ∏è Icebox","title":"Make a slash governance proposal"},{"content":{"body":"","number":19487,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature]Migrate x/evidence to use Environment ","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/19487"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgM01Ok","labels":["C:server/v2"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/19482"],"priority ":"Medium","project":"Server","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"[Feature]Migrate x/evidence to use Environment "},{"assignees":["tac0turtle"],"content":{"body":"### Summary\n\nadd consensus message handling in accordance with rfc 06 of votes in consensus. \n\n### Problem Definition\n\n_No response_\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nsetting votes does not need to be in state since its provided each height. \r\n\r\nmigrate module to query info from slashing instetad of cometinfo from context ","number":19492,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature(slashing)]: vote info consensus message","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/19492"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgM1WB8","labels":["T:feature-request","C:server/v2"],"priority ":"High","project":"Server","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"[Feature(slashing)]: vote info consensus message"},{"assignees":["tac0turtle"],"content":{"body":"### Summary\n\nadd consensus message for evidence \n\n### Problem Definition\n\n_No response_\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\ndoes not need to be stored in state (?)\r\n\r\nmodify other modules if needed to rely on evidence. \r\n\r\n\r\nif the value is nil in the cache then use context, would mean that the user is not using server/v2 ","number":19493,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature(evidence]: consensus message for evidence ","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/19493"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgM1Wxk","labels":["T:feature-request","C:server/v2"],"priority ":"High","project":"Server","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"[Feature(evidence]: consensus message for evidence "},{"assignees":["facundomedica","tac0turtle"],"content":{"body":"### Summary\n\nimplement server.go to combine all the services and plugins\n\n### Problem Definition\n\n_No response_\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nimplement server/v2/cometbft/server.go","number":19494,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature(server/v2/cometbft)]: server combine ","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/19494"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgM1WzM","labels":["T:feature-request","C:server/v2"],"priority ":"Critical","project":"Server","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","story Type":"‚≠êÔ∏è User story","title":"[Feature(server/v2/cometbft)]: server combine "},{"content":{"body":"### Summary\n\nCurrently, in the Cosmos SDK when a user submits a tx, if the tx translates into a new state object we charge the same amount of gas as. an item in state that is being updated.

In server/v2 we designed the new system in a way to allow for new binaries to be created around proving and light clients. In order for us to achieve this work we need to make changes to the current modules and create ways for users to write modules without native iteration. \r\n\r\nNative iteration, which we have in the sdk currently, is the process of iterating without a start and stop of the underlying data, i.e. execution iterates all data without a defined start and stop until the function stops. This design makes it difficult to prove. When talking with zkVM teams this was the largest bottleneck to zkvm adoption in the software. Iteration can still be done for queries, but modules that rely on queries from other modules need to be aware where iteration is happening, if they would like to prove execution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWith many new zkVMs emerging we have the opportunity to add zk proving of execution as a feature in the sdk. This can be used for IBC zk rollups and many other features.  \r\n\r\n### Work Breakdown\r\n\r\nThe below task list is high level and will be broken down as each phase begins. \r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\r\n### Phase 1\r\n- [ ] Identify iteration in state execution, we should check the overall design and see if we need iteration or if there is a non iterative approach of writing the feature(s)\r\n- [ ] Migrate simplest paths of native iteration to non native iteration or drop iteration\r\n- [ ] Create iteration collection types (treemap, etc..)\r\n- [ ] Document how to use collection based iteration instead of native iteration\r\n```\r\n```[tasklist]\r\n### Phase 2\r\n- [ ] Migrate complex paths of iteration (may be larger refactors)\r\n- [ ] Create proving binary\r\n- [ ] zkVM integration\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n```\r\n","number":19906,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Epic]: Proving Execution","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/19906"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgN3E_U","labels":["T:Epic"],"project":"2024 üÜô & ‚û°  üìà","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","size":"X-Large (6+ weeks)","status":"üìã Backlog","story Type":"üëë Epic","title":"[Epic]: Proving Execution"},{"content":{"body":"### Summary\n\nWe'd like to utilise a `KeySet` of an arbitrary gogo protobuf message.

Initially, when the network activity is low, a longer block interval (e.g., 60 seconds) can save resources. As the network grows and transaction demand increases, the community might need to shorten the block interval (e.g., to 3 seconds) to increase transaction throughput and improve user experience.\r\n\r\n### Solution Impact\r\nIntroducing a mechanism for on-chain governance to adjust the block interval would empower network validators and stakeholders to vote on and implement changes that best fit the network's evolving needs. This flexibility could enhance network efficiency, reduce costs during low-usage periods, and increase throughput during high-usage periods, aligning network performance with actual demand.\n\n### Problem Definition\n\n_No response_\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\n### Description\r\nThe proposal is to add a feature in Cosmos SDK that allows on-chain governance to dynamically adjust the block interval. This could be achieved by making the block interval a parameter that can be modified through governance proposals and votes.\r\n\r\n- **Governance-controlled Block Interval**: Introduce a new parameter in the blockchain's governance module that represents the block interval. Validators and token holders can propose and vote on changes to this parameter.\r\n- **Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism**: Implement a mechanism that adjusts the block creation process based on the current block interval parameter. This would require changes in the consensus module to respect the block interval set by governance decisions.\r\n- **Safety Measures**: To prevent abrupt or harmful changes, introduce safeguards like minimum and maximum limits for the block interval and require a significant majority for such changes.\r\n\r\nThis feature would allow the network to adapt its performance to its operational context and community preferences, thereby enhancing its scalability and responsiveness to user needs.","number":19914,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature]: Adjusting Block Interval Dynamically for Improved Network Scalability and TPS Through Governance in Cosmos SDK","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/19914"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgN6CPc","labels":["T:feature-request"],"repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"‚òÉÔ∏è Icebox","title":"[Feature]: Adjusting Block Interval Dynamically for Improved Network Scalability and TPS Through Governance in Cosmos SDK"},{"content":{"body":"## Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, the x/mint module calculates the token issuance (affected by inflation) based on block times i.e., users need to calculate how many blocks they will have in a year which is influenced by block times.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nTo improve consistency and predictability in token issuance, we propose migrating away from block-based issuance and adopting time-based issuance using epochs in the x/mint module.\r\nCurrently, we use BlocksPerYear param to calculate the provisions for a block and to determine the rate change for inflation. This should be adjusted to epochs time intervals rather than blocks per year. Define the duration of each epoch and adjust the issuance calculation accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Steps to follow:\r\n\r\n- Modify the issuance calculation logic in the x/mint module to use time-based metrics instead of block numbers.\r\n- Implement a mechanism to calculate issuance on a per-epoch basis, considering factors such as target inflation rate, epoch duration, and total time elapsed.\r\n- Define epochs on-chain timers that execute at fixed time intervals (e.g., days, weeks, months) to serve as the basis for calculating token issuance. We register the logic to be executed at the timer ticks.\r\n- Set module hooks: on hook receiver function, we need to filter epochIdentifier and only do executions for only specific epochIdentifier.

That's an alias for the `protoreflect.ProtoMessage` interface, which just requires the `ProtoReflect() Message` method. But code generated from protos does not create that method on anything.\r\n\r\nAll of the unit tests related to signing uses the pulsar stuff. But those things aren't what are actually used by the msg server. So there's no way to define a custom `GetSigners` method for anything that someone would be actually signing.\r\n\r\n### Cosmos SDK Version\r\n\r\n0.50.5\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce?\r\n\r\nHere's the simplified situation I'm in where I need to define a custom `GetSigners` method.\r\n\r\n```proto\r\nservice Msg {\r\n  rpc StartThing(MsgStartThingRequest) MsgStartThingResponse;\r\n  rpc EndThing(MsgEndThingRequest) MsgEndThingResponse;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage MsgStartThingRequest {\r\n  Thing thing = 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage MsgStartThingResponse {}\r\n\r\nmessage MsgEndThingRequest {\r\n  Thing thing = 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage MsgEndThingResponse {}\r\n\r\nmessage Thing {\r\n  string addr1 = 1  [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = \"cosmos.AddressString\"];\r\n  string addr2 = 2  [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = \"cosmos.AddressString\"];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe signer of `MsgStartThingRequest` should be `thing.addr1`.\r\nThe signer of `MsgEndThingRequest` should be `thing.addr2`.\r\n\r\nI can't use `option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer)` here because it no longer allows sub-fields. I.e., in `MsgStartThingRequest`, I can't have `option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = \"thing.addr1\"`, I can only have `option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = \"thing\"`. I'd then have to put an `option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer)` in the `Thing` message, but it can't be hard-coded like that because the field that's the signer is different depending on which `Msg` the `Thing` is in. And there are other `message`s that also have a `Thing` where neither should be a signer.\r\n\r\nIn the go code, the msg server endpoint methods require the use of the `MsgStartThingRequest` struct as defined in the auto-generated go code that lives in the module code. Those `Msg` structs (where we used to have to define `GetSigners()`), do not have a `ProtoReflect()` method, though. So it's impossible to define a custom `GetSigners` function on a `Msg` required by an endpoint.\r\n\r\nHere's what the go code might look like to define the custom `GetSigners` for `MsgStartThingRequest`:\r\n```go\r\n\toptions.DefineCustomGetSigners(proto.MessageName(&MsgStartThingRequest{}), func(msgIn proto.Message) ([][]byte, error) {\r\n\t\tmsg, ok := msgIn.(*MsgStartThingRequest)\r\n\t\tif !ok {\r\n\t\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"incorrect message type, actual: %T, expected: %T\", msgIn, &MsgStartThingRequest{})\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\taddr, err := options.AddressCodec.StringToBytes(msgCP.Thing.Addr1)\r\n\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\treturn nil, err\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn [][]byte{addr}, nil\r\n\t})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that, `options` is a `cosmossdk.io/x/tx/signing.Options`, and `proto` is the `google.golang.org/protobuf/proto` package.\r\n\r\nThere are two compilation issues with that code.\r\n1. `proto.MessageName` takes in a `protoreflect.ProtoMessage`, but `MsgStartThingRequest` doesn't have a `ProtoReflect()` method, so `&MsgStartThingRequest{}` is an invalid argument for that function.\r\n2. The `proto.Message` type that the function takes in, is just an alias for that `protoreflect.ProtoMessage`. So `msgIn` cannot be asserted as a `(*MsgStartThingRequest)` because again, `MsgStartThingRequest` does not have a `ProtoReflect()` method.","number":20077,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Bug]: DefineCustomGetSigners is unusable.","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/20077"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgOVLI0","labels":["T:Bug"],"repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","title":"[Bug]: DefineCustomGetSigners is unusable."},{"assignees":["tac0turtle"],"content":{"body":"# Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/compare/v0.47.10...release/v0.47.x\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Author Checklist\r\n\r\n*All items are required.

We have seen data teams spend countless hours building complex systems allowing them to build front ends. \r\n\r\nState streaming is a good step towards allowing teams to build off chain indexes. It has its limitations. State streaming is not a first class citizen forcing off chain actors to need to decode data. This leads to complex software being built.\r\n\r\nlastly the state machine is creating countless more writes which are needed for querying. This increases the amount of io a state machine does. In order to reduce over head, create a more performant state machine it should only hold the state needed for going to the next block. Extra information for queries should be handled with a in process off chain indexer. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis epic proposes changes to  the state machine and the creation of an in process off chain indexer allowing users to build more complex applications without being prohibited by maintaining complex pieces of software. \r\n\r\nThe feature should have a plugin based system allowing teams to extend the indexing functionality to create a richer schema than the default which will be offered by the cosmos sdk team. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few things to be aware of. The state machine has a differentiation between deleted data and pruned data. Deleted data refers to the removal of data due to an action. Pruning of data within in the state machine refers to data that is not needed for the state machine to continue and is removed but it is useful for users to know this information later on. \r\n\r\n### Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIndexing of state events and blocks is a complex process with countless steps needed in order to get enough information to build complex applications. \r\n\r\n\r\nstate streaming is not a first class citizen within the software forcing users to decode the data received. \r\n\r\n\r\nthe state machine is storing more data than it needs to due to queries.

To achieve this, I am considering building a custom version of our application that includes only the necessary modules. This should significantly reduce the binary size and improve performance. My plan is to split our application into multiple binaries, with each binary handling different sets of modules. This approach should allow us to manage modules with distinct responsibilities or resource requirements more effectively.\r\n\r\nThe proposed design involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n**1. Define Two Separate Applications:**\r\n- Create two different application definitions, each including only the necessary modules.\r\n\r\n**2. Create Separate `app.go` Files:**\r\n```\r\n/app\r\n   /app1.go\r\n   /app2.go\r\n```\r\n- For instance, we would have `app1.go` and `app2.go` in the `app/` directory, each initializing a different set of modules.\r\n\r\n**3. Update Build Scripts:**\r\n- Modify our build scripts to compile these two different applications into separate binaries.\r\n```\r\nbuild:\r\n    go build -o build/app1 ./app/app1.go\r\n    go build -o build/app2 ./app/app2.go\r\n```\r\n\r\n**4. Deploy and Run:**\r\n- Deploy and run these two binaries independently.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to split the workload and manage resources more effectively. Each binary will only handle the modules it includes, potentially reducing the overall resource usage per node.\r\n\r\n**Concerns:**\r\n- One of my primary concerns is ensuring that the two separate binaries can use the same Tendermint connection, as our overall application relies on consistent and unified communication with Tendermint.\r\n\r\nCould you please advise if this approach is feasible with the Cosmos SDK? Additionally, any insights or best practices you could share regarding the implementation of this design would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your assistance.\r\n@tac0turtle\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>","number":20500,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"Custom Build Options: Split our application into multiple

A lot of modules do not have any differences, even though there are ops in the logs indicating that the state was successfully changed.\r\n\r\nI first found this in my own chain's sim. For a specific seed (that got used randomly), in block 3, op 11 is a x/group `SubmitProposal` which involves picking a random group, and calling the `GroupInfo` query. That query returns a \"not found\" error when the group doesn't exist, and the op isn't expecting an error for that case, so the error is propagated up and ultimately stops the sim early. This seed's genesis doesn't have any group entries. On blocks 1 and 2, the first x/group op is `CreateGroup`, which means the later ops (in the same block) have at least one group to randomly pick from. But in block 3, the first x/group op is `SubmitProposal`, so it tries to get group `0` resulting in that \"not found\" error.\r\n\r\nThe genesis json files for each seed (1 block vs 10 blocks) showed differences in these modules: bank, distribution, evidence, mint, slashing, and staking. But they have identical values for these modules: auth, authz, circuit, crisis, feegrant, genutil, gov, group, nft, upgrade, and vesting.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, I added some `fmt.Printf` calls in the group keeper to ouput values coming from `groupTable.Sequence()`. During each block, the numbers go up as expected, but the first x/group op in each block shows that the sequence has gone back to its genesis value. This is true for all the sims, and also for all the seeds that I've tried. I also tried both the `memdb` and `golangdb` backends, and both had the same symptoms.\r\n\r\n### Cosmos SDK Version\r\n\r\nv0.50.6\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce?\r\n\r\nIn a terminal:\r\n1.

Use case: send many transactions in tests\".\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nStandard practice can be using the current unix time (in milliseconds) as the sequence number which is a stateless way to go about things (does not require querying the chain or keeping track of in-flight messages, assuming it takes at least 1 millisecond between signing new transactions).\r\n\r\nThe `x/auth/Params` can have three new fields:\r\n- `bool allow_sequence_skips`\r\n  - if `true`, allow sequence numbers to be skipped\r\n  - default: `false`\r\n- `uint64 num_stored_sequences`\r\n  - Store the highest n sequence numbers instead of the single highest sequence number\r\n  - This allows the transactions to hit the chain/nodes in a different order than the order in which they were sent\r\n  - default: `1`\r\n- `uint64 sequence_buffer_milliseconds`\r\n  - if non-zero, then any sequence numbers greater than `ctx.BlockTime().UnixMilli() + sequence_buffer_ms` are considered invalid\r\n  - This prevents users from accidentally ‚Äúlocking‚Äù their account by using math.MaxUint64 as the sequence number\r\n  - This prevents dapps from DOSing other dapps by using a too-high sequence number value\r\n  - default: `86,400,000` (1 day in milliseconds)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `uint64 sequence` field on the `BaseAccount` would be replaced with a `repeated uint64 highest_sequences` field that is at-most `num_stored_sequences` in length.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to avoid overloading the current `sequence` field and instead add `repeated uint64 nonces` field to `BaseAccount`. Any `tx.sequence` values greater-than `2^40` will be assumed to be nonces. This allows dapps to use either traditional sequence numbers or the newer skippable nonce values without interfering with each other.","number":20617,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature]: Non-sequential `x/auth` sequence numbers","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/20617"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgP8UBg","labels":["T:feature-request","C:x/auth"],"repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","title":"[Feature]: Non-sequential `x/auth` sequence numbers"},{"assignees":["kocubinski"],"content":{"body":"How bad is the breakage?","number":20620,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Spike]: Explore removal of protobuf from core","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/20620"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgP8xUE","labels":["C:core"],"repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","title":"[Spike]: Explore removal of protobuf from core"},{"content":{"body":"### Summary\n\nIn store/v2, SC is atomic and it can roll back to the previous version.

When attempting to add a module on multiple validator nodes, everything runs fine if all validators remain running post-upgrade. However, manually stopping and restarting a validator node results in a consensus issue. The specific error is:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nERR prevote step: consensus deems this block invalid; prevoting nil err=\"wrong Block.Header.AppHash.  Expected ..., got ...\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe spent several weeks troubleshooting this, including:\r\n\r\n1. Reviewing code for random values, time, maps, etc.\r\n2.

Migrating the module to simapp to check if the issue could be reproduced\r\n\r\nWe ultimately found that having multiple structs in the keeper and modifying one of the struct's values in EndBlocker causes the consensus failure. We created a minimal module based on v0.50.6 to test the upgrade, adding an almost empty testmodule with only the UpdateParams method and the data structure to be tested.\r\n\r\nThe changes based on v0.50.6 are here: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/compare/v0.50.6...lmkdbd:cosmos-sdk:test\r\n\r\nIn the following cases, the upgrade version is fully compiled from v0.50.6 code:\r\n\r\n1.

So we have JSON state objects converted then into protobuf ones (or whatever the state representation is). \r\n- `Exporting a chain`'s state: this is the reverse process of `Initting a chain` in which the state encoding is converted into JSON encoidng.\r\n\r\n# problem\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this way of doing genesis is often inflexible and conflates state export and import (in a human readable format) with incepting the initial state of a chain.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nI would propose to split the genesis into two scopes:\r\n- State export and import\r\n- Chain Inception\r\n\r\nThe first issue is being indirectly solved by the indexer work @aaronc is doing with standardized schemas and collections becoming more human friendly in their JSON representation.\r\n\r\nthe second problem is `chain inception`, for this I would like to propose that we make genesis message based, what does it mean to be message based:\r\n\r\nit fundamentally means that genesis is just a list of ordered state transitions being executed.\r\n\r\nFor example, the current status quo on bank makes us do the following:\r\n- Set bank denoms, set balances, etc etc.\r\n\r\nHow this would change in a message based genesis:\r\n- The first message would be a `MsgCreateDenom { denom: uatom, etc.. }`\r\n- The second message would be: `MsgMintCoins { coin: { denom: uatom, amount: 1000}, address: cosmos1234 } }`\r\n\r\nThe runner of these messages can be a specialized \"address\" which is treated by modules as a super user.\r\n\r\n# advantages\r\n\r\n- Clean differentiation between state export, import and chain inception.\r\n- No need for order init genesis, since the order is determined by the messages being executed.\r\n- It is possible to alternate genesis steps between modules: eg a genesis could be `accounts.MsgCreateAccount`, `bank.MsgMintBalance`, `accounts.MsgCreateAccount`, and the dependencies between modules can become more loose.\r\n- The genesis flow becomes easier to reason about since we do not need to reason in terms of big chunks of module state being applied but we can see genesis as a series of events (transactions) being executed in order.\r\n- It would make serverv2 encapsulate state transition changes as just messages being executed.","number":20780,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"feat(genesis): Refactor Genesis to be message based","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/20780"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgQZjeQ","labels":["S:proposed"],"repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","title":"feat(genesis): Refactor Genesis to be message based"},{"content":{"body":"### Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently modules rely on consensus level steps (finalizeblock) to begin a new block in testing.

We also wanted to issue utility tokens for gaming purposes within our Cosmos-based metaverse, but again we deemed it not possible at this time. So, it is clear that Cosmos ecosystem development is being held up both in terms of security-tokens and real-world asset securitization, and also metaverse / gaming aspects, because of this crucial missing piece.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nIf you look at: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/\r\n\r\nYou can see that there is a list of supported functionalities of the ERC721 standard, namely:\r\n\r\n    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);\r\n\r\n    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);\r\n\r\n    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;\r\n\r\n    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;\r\n\r\n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;\r\n\r\n    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;\r\n\r\n    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;\r\n\r\n    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);\r\n\r\n    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);\r\n\r\nHowever, we also need some \"preparatory\" methods in the Cosmos chain, which are sort of assumed to have already been called when an ERC721 token contract is created on the ethereum blockchain. Namely, we need the functionalities already written by the Coreum team and described here: https://github.com/CoreumFoundation/coreum/blob/master/x/asset/nft/spec/README.md\r\n\r\nWe are asking that the Cosmos team works to pull in the updates to enable full functionality of the NFT module, potentially working with the Coreum team as possible / necessary to understand exactly what needs to be pulled in. I am personally not able to make a PR to the effect right now so I'm asking that some developer/s be assigned. If we need to make some sort of grant or bounty for this update, maybe that could be arranged also.\r\n","number":20791,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"[Feature]: ERC 721 module be updated to include functions such as token creation and minting events","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/20791"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgQbm3s","labels":["T:feature-request"],"repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"üìã Backlog","title":"[Feature]: ERC 721 module be updated to include functions such as token creation and minting events"},{"assignees":["testinginprod"],"content":{"body":"wire grpc and gateway for querying ","number":20798,"repository":"cosmos/cosmos-sdk","title":"server/v2: wire grpc and gateway","type":"Issue","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/20798"},"id":"PVTI_lADOAAN9684ABqEwzgQdZrg","labels":["T: Client UX","C:server/v2"],"linked pull requests":["https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/21038"],"priority ":"Critical","project":"Server","repository":"https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","status":"ü•≥ Done","title":"server/v2: wire grpc and gateway"},{"content":{"body":"begin a spike of the bank module for integration tests to get an understanding of the changes needed then based on the changes we can evaluate what needs to be done for the other tests. \r\n\r\nGoal: have integration tests work for v1 & v2.

the application home directory (e.g., $HOME/.simapp), so it can detect upgrade-info.json and perform backups from the data directory.\r\n\r\nOne case where this can add complexity to the setup is using Cosmovisor inside Docker images.

Configuration\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[statesync]\r\n# State sync rapidly bootstraps a new node by discovering, fetching, and restoring a state machine\r\n# snapshot from peers instead of fetching and replaying historical blocks. Requires some peers in\r\n# the network to take and serve state machine snapshots. State sync is not attempted if the node\r\n# has any local state (LastBlockHeight > 0). The node will have a truncated block history,\r\n# starting from the height of the snapshot.\r\nenable = true\r\n\r\n# RPC servers (comma-separated) for light client verification of the synced state machine and\r\n# retrieval of state data for node bootstrapping. Also needs a trusted height and corresponding\r\n# header hash obtained from a trusted source, and a period during which validators can be trusted.\r\n#\r\n# For Cosmos SDK-based chains, trust_period should usually be about 2/3 of the unbonding time (~2\r\n# weeks) during which they can be financially punished (slashed) for misbehavior.\r\nrpc_servers = \"http://localhost:26699,http://localhost:26699\"\r\ntrust_height = 23608000\r\ntrust_hash = \"D81553243F02857403E0B4148EDBDF0DC26F2A13D23134B5FCF2949C4470280D\"\r\ntrust_period = \"168h0m0s\"\r\n\r\n# Time to spend discovering snapshots before initiating a restore.\r\ndiscovery_time = \"1m0s\"\r\n\r\n# Temporary directory for state sync snapshot chunks, defaults to the OS tempdir (typically /tmp).\r\n# Will create a new, randomly named directory within, and remove it when done.\r\ntemp_dir = \"\"\r\n\r\n# The timeout duration before re-requesting a chunk, possibly from a different\r\n# peer (default: 1 minute).\r\nchunk_request_timeout = \"30s\"\r\n\r\n# The number of concurrent chunk fetchers to run (default: 1).\r\nchunk_fetchers = \"2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error makes it appear like it's trying to fetch a block or block result at a specific height and timing out. I can curl and fetch that block on the order of milliseconds so it's confusing why the light client seems to not be able to do the same. Is there a config that controls the light client timeout?\r\n\r\nWhat's also a bit confusing is that it's trying to fetch a height before the snapshot height. If the state sync is successful, it's earliest height will be the state sync height + 1 so what's the significance of fetching older blocks?\r\n\r\nAnother point of confusion is why the snapshot height requested (and available on the snapshot node) is not a height matched on the Discovered new snapshot lines?\n\n### Cosmos SDK Version\n\nv0.50.7\n\n### How to reproduce?\n\n_No
